I return to this point in a few moments.</alinea></para><para id="pa7"><no>7</no><alinea> I am delivering the second inaugural F.R. Scott lecture. I want to start by going back to the first one, given by my predecessor, Rod Macdonald, on February 16, 1996. On that occasion, the Scott Professor reminded those present of the many ways in which Frank Scott had been, as Rod put it, “a “great Canadian”.<renvoi id="re1no1" idref="no1" typeref="note">1</renvoi> That Frank Scott could win the Governor General’s Award twice, once for his work in constitutional law and once for his work as a poet, is evidence of his unique capacities and contributions to public life.<renvoi id="re1no2" idref="no2" typeref="note">2</renvoi> Rod said that it was an “honour” to deliver his lecture but also a “daunting task”, for Frank Scott was “an intellectual giant; [and] I do little more than walk in his shadow.”<renvoi id="re1no3" idref="no3" typeref="note">3</renvoi></alinea></para><para id="pa8"><no>8</no><alinea> Of course, at this time Rod Macdonald was already one of Canada’s distinguished intellectuals himself. I will not list his accomplishments now—that would take more time than we have. But I do wish to register for the record my own view that Rod was beloved at McGill and throughout the legal academy in Canada and beyond because of his generous and original spirit, because of his ability to infuse within his students and colleagues a sense of wonder and optimism about law’s potential for good, and because of his steadfast refusal to accept orthodoxy as authority.<renvoi id="re1no4" idref="no4" typeref="note">4</renvoi> If Rod Macdonald was walking in the shadow of Frank Scott, what am I doing? If it possible to walk in the shadow of a giant who walks in the shadow of a giant, then that is what I am doing. Rod may have been appointed to the Scott Chair because of his achievements, but I get the sense that I have been appointed because of my <marquage typemarq="italique">potential</marquage> achievements. My new colleagues have placed their trust in me to fulfill that potential, and I am deeply honoured and humbled to be given the opportunity.</alinea></para><para id="pa9"><no>9</no><alinea> So, then, let me begin. This evening, I want to defend a theory of constitutional value that is premised upon what I will call “normative unity”. I have, however, chosen the title of my lecture carefully. First, I wish only to gesture “toward” such a theory. I will not try to offer a complete account. I am, as it were, letting myself off the hook. Second, you will have noted that I have also alluded in the title to that most-important of McGill ideas, “pluralism”. My objective, then, is to offer some critical reflections about the ideals of unity and pluralism in constitutional law and how they may be seen to be mutually <marquage typemarq="italique">reinforcing</marquage> rather than <marquage typemarq="italique">conflicting</marquage> ideals. In particular, I want to examine and ultimately reject a view that appears to be gaining ground in Canada: the view that the Canadian constitution is characterized by something called “agonistic constitutionalism”. “Agonism” is a term derived from the Greek word <marquage typemarq="italique">agon</marquage>, meaning conflict or strife, and within moral and political philosophy it has come to represent a conflict-focused account of pluralism.<renvoi id="re1no5" idref="no5" typeref="note">5</renvoi></alinea></para><para id="pa10"><no>10</no><alinea> I should, however, be clear in this respect. There is no question that persistent disagreement and therefore debate about basic constitutional values is not just inevitable but should be welcomed and cherished within any democratic pluralistic society. I want to suggest, however, that disagreement is not inconsistent with the commitment to the kind of normative unity that is necessary for the ideals associated with legality or constitutionalism to flourish. My concern is that the invocation of agonism may obscure this fundamental point. We are not yet in a post-truth world, though that world seems at times threatening, and so I think that we need a theory of constitutionalism that allows us to take a stand and to defend the truth about the meaning of certain basic constitutional values, including liberty, equality, democracy, justice, and, of course, legality or the rule of law. That theory must, at the same time, accept and defend another constitutional value, the value of pluralism. These are the values that must hold together, somehow, as a coherent whole if individuals, communities, and nations are to be equally valued and respected within Canada and the world beyond.</alinea></para><para id="pa11"><no>11</no><alinea> But what about this business of the hedgehog? It was, of course, Isaiah Berlin who famously stated in a 1953 essay: “There is a line among the fragments of the Greek poet Archilochus which says: ‘The fox knows many things, but the hedgehog knows one big thing.’”<renvoi id="re1no6" idref="no6" typeref="note">6</renvoi> Berlin proceeded to explain that certain scholars are like foxes because they are fast and clever and pursue many ends and hold many ideas not all of which are related or consistent, and others are like hedgehogs because they seek gradually to reveal a single central vision that is more or less coherent. The commonly accepted view is that Isaiah Berlin was a fox par excellence.<renvoi id="re1no7" idref="no7" typeref="note">7</renvoi> In his most famous essay, “Two Concepts of Liberty”, Berlin argued that liberal societies are, or should be, marked by two basic features: first, a commitment to so-called negative liberty, the idea that the individual has the right to exercise freedoms protected from the state; and, second, the acknowledgment of pluralism or value pluralism, the idea that freedom allows each person to develop conceptions of value or good of their own which will invariably be, among the people of any liberal community, multiple and conflicting.<renvoi id="re1no8" idref="no8" typeref="note">8</renvoi></alinea></para><para id="pa12"><no>12</no><alinea> The basic question that I would like to address is whether pluralism means we must be foxes—or, in other words, whether if we are hedgehogs, we must deny pluralism. The answer to this question given by the legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin in his epic account of ethics and political morality, <marquage typemarq="italique">Justice for Hedgehogs</marquage>, is that we should be hedgehogs and reject value pluralism.<renvoi id="re1no9" idref="no9" typeref="note">9</renvoi> But what does this really mean? Does the hedgehog really have to reject pluralism altogether? Hedgehogs are notoriously shy creatures. They are hard to find at the best of times. Finding a <marquage typemarq="italique">pluralistic </marquage>hedgehog might well be impossible. But that is our task this evening.</alinea></para><para id="pa13"><no>13</no><alinea>In pursuing this end in this inaugural lecture, it will be helpful for me to go back to the point where my predecessor ended his inaugural lecture. After a careful assessment of Frank Scott’s understanding of the Canadian constitution, Rod Macdonald concluded that this understanding left several challenges for the constitution unaddressed. One of those challenges he identified as follows:</alinea>
        <bloccitation>
          <alinea>[H]ow should governments respond to the challenges of pluralism? The forging of a
            unitary Canadian civic identity, so central to F.R. Scott’s constitutional vision, has
            little to say about the recognition and accommodation of ethnic and cultural diversity
            in a modem multicultural state such as Canada. Rather, it is the theme of multiple
            allegiances—the need to mediate between different and divided loyalties within a state
            that does not seek to impose a homogeneous view of citizenship—that makes the explicit
            claims of <marquage typemarq="italique">Charter </marquage>patriots possible.<renvoi id="re1no10" idref="no10" typeref="note">10</renvoi> </alinea>
        </bloccitation>
        <alinea>Rod no doubt understood that Scott was a product of his time, and that given his
          experiences of living through the Depression and the Duplessis era in Quebec it would have
          been natural for him to assume that the ambitious project of building a modern
          social-democratic state would require strong federal vision and action—or a unitary civic
          identity. Macdonald’s actual concern about Scott’s constitutionalism ran to a different,
          deeper level. Rod was struck by the fact that Scott, despite his stature as a great
          Canadian poet, was relatively unpoetic in his approach to the constitution. The
          constitution according to Scott was, Rod thought, all <marquage typemarq="italique">reason</marquage> and no <marquage typemarq="italique">rhyme</marquage>. As Rod
          concluded: “The key challenges now facing Canada”—he had just mentioned pluralism, divided
          loyalties, multiple allegiances, and a heterogeneous view of citizenship “cannot be
          addressed without the rediscovery of rhyme and the celebration of both rhyme and reason in
          Canadian constitutionalism.”<renvoi id="re1no11" idref="no11" typeref="note">11</renvoi></alinea></para><para id="pa14"><no>14</no><alinea> The idea that rhyme is important to the value of constitutionalism in a pluralistic society strikes me as an important insight. Two figures overshadow much of modern legal and jurisprudential thought. These figures have been known by different names at different times and in different places. Facing off against each other, we find, for example, reason and will, principle and policy, right and might, <marquage typemarq="italique">jus</marquage> and <marquage typemarq="italique">lex</marquage>, justice and power, rationality and politics. Whatever names they bear, the power of their influence upon legal thought often leads us to accept an artificial binary that obscures essential truths about the value of legality. Law is not just a matter of either reason or right on the one hand and power or politics on the other. There is between them, Rod Macdonald reminds us, the moderating and humanizing influence of rhyme.</alinea></para><para id="pa15"><no>15</no><alinea> I am not certain that Rod would have agreed with me, but I think that rhyme is evident in two venerable strands of European legal thought. Renaissance humanists in France, and the English common lawyers in the time of Sir Edward Coke who were influenced by them, developed new approaches to the understanding of “logic” by turning to the ancient idea of “rhetoric” and its insistence upon harmony or elegance in the structuring of arguments.<renvoi id="re1no12" idref="no12" typeref="note">12</renvoi> The common law, on this view, becomes, as the early seventeenth-century judge John Doderidge said, an “art” of reasoning in which “the truth is found out by [a]rgument, debate, and discourse of reason on both parts”.<renvoi id="re1no13" idref="no13" typeref="note">13</renvoi> There is arguably a sense of rhyme implicit within rhetoric.</alinea></para><para id="pa16"><no>16</no><alinea> Rhyme may also be seen within the ancient concept of <marquage typemarq="italique">aequitas</marquage>, or equity in its broadest sense. The <marquage typemarq="italique">jus gentium</marquage> in Roman law, wrote the nineteenth-century legal philosopher John Austin, was “the law <marquage typemarq="italique">common</marquage> to ...various nations, or administered <marquage typemarq="italique">equally</marquage> or <marquage typemarq="italique">universally</marquage> to members of these various nations” and was thus also styled “<marquage typemarq="italique">jus aequum</marquage>, <marquage typemarq="italique">jus aequabile</marquage>, <marquage typemarq="italique">aequitas</marquage>”, with the term “<marquage typemarq="italique">aequitas</marquage>” meaning, he said, “<marquage typemarq="italique">conformity</marquage> or <marquage typemarq="italique">consonance</marquage> to a common or equal law.”<renvoi id="re1no14" idref="no14" typeref="note">14</renvoi> Given its “large and liberal spirit”, <marquage typemarq="italique">aequitas</marquage> came to be known for its “<marquage typemarq="italique">universality</marquage>” and “gradually came to signify <marquage typemarq="italique">impartiality</marquage>.”<renvoi id="re1no15" idref="no15" typeref="note">15</renvoi> Its “radical idea”, Austin concluded, was that law “should be applied <marquage typemarq="italique">uniformly</marquage> to <marquage typemarq="italique">all</marquage> the cases which come within its principle” and so it was based upon the value of “harmony or <marquage typemarq="italique">elegantia</marquage>” and it was opposed to “incoherency.”<renvoi id="re1no16" idref="no16" typeref="note">16</renvoi></alinea></para><para id="pa17"><no>17</no><alinea> Like Austin, Sir Henry Maine extolled the virtues of the Roman praetorian system with its vibrant body of case law based on “Aequitas”.<renvoi id="re1no17" idref="no17" typeref="note">17</renvoi> And like Austin, he emphasized the basic ideal of equality underlying this law: through the judicial search for “equal or proportionate distribution”, the principle of the “‘equality’ of laws” led to a “constant <marquage typemarq="italique">levelling</marquage> or removal of irregularities.”<renvoi id="re1no18" idref="no18" typeref="note">18</renvoi> The Roman jurisconsults had “freely surrendered themselves” to “their sense of simplicity and harmony—of what they significantly termed ‘elegance.’”<renvoi id="re1no19" idref="no19" typeref="note">19</renvoi> As the sixteenth-century English jurist, Christopher St. German, wrote—summarizing a point accepted by centuries of common law judges— the unwritten law of reason ensures that <marquage typemarq="italique">aequitas</marquage> is implicitly part of every written or positive law, rounding off its edges to avoid unjust results that general terms may produce in specific cases.<renvoi id="re1no20" idref="no20" typeref="note">20</renvoi> </alinea></para><para id="pa18"><no>18</no><alinea> Ideas of harmony, elegance, balance, proportion, coherence, integrity, symmetry, consistency, and reconciliation all have something to do with the juridical union of rhyme and reason. These are ideas that suggest an ideal of normative unity. How else could the objective of equal respect for everyone implicit within the concept of legality be realized? Yet the application of this ideal of legal elegance or harmony was not a matter of cold logic or reason aimed at bland sameness. It was not difference, but the prospect of discordance or disharmony within the law that was the concern.</alinea></para><para id="pa19"><no>19</no><alinea> There is probably good reason to think that the concept of constitutional rhyme informs Indigenous legal traditions as well, though, if so, in very different ways. My thoughts in this respect are offered tentatively and with a sense of humility, for my ability to interpret traditions of a very different set of cultures from my own is limited and even the attempt comes with moral risk.<renvoi id="re1no21" idref="no21" typeref="note">21</renvoi> As far as I can gather, however, it does seem that for the peoples indigenous to this part of the world, that is, the Great Lakes watershed and the St. Lawrence River valley—the Haudenosaunee and the Anishinaabe peoples in particular—legal order was, and perhaps still is, a matter of seeking harmony between a complex series of shifting normative spheres or domains.<renvoi id="re1no22" idref="no22" typeref="note">22</renvoi> Families, clans, villages, nations, and confederacies of nations represented a dynamic network of interconnecting jurisdictional domains—a kaleidoscope of jurisdictions really—within and between which normative meaning evolved through conference and council, and the forging of duties of trust and care by exchanges of gifts that formed a sort of spiritual kinship between peoples and communities.<renvoi id="re1no23" idref="no23" typeref="note">23</renvoi> These normative spheres shifted constantly in part because they were integrated within a dynamic physical environment that was alive spiritually with its own shifting normative spheres, and the constant search for normative order among people involved seeking balanced relations within and between these spheres or domains. Legality was thus grounded within the homeland of the people, though it was not territorial in the European sense, and did not involve the assertion of authority by a single sovereign over the land. It came rather through the daily effort to negotiate good relations in a swirling jurisdictional environment that shaped multiple sets of allegiances for people with layered and complex senses of identity.</alinea></para><para id="pa20"><no>20</no><alinea> The customary norms that governed relations within and between Haudenosaunee and Anishinaabe communities were extended to the treaty relationship with Europeans and informed, for example, the “covenant chain” relationship linking all nations within the Great Lakes region with the Crown, a relationship that was affirmed at (among other treaty councils) the Niagara council convened by the Crown’s representative, Sir William Johnson, in 1764.<renvoi id="re1no24" idref="no24" typeref="note">24</renvoi> On this occasion, as on many others, wampum belts—belts, that is, of white and purple sea shells carefully woven together to produce images of national friendship and national autonomy—were exchanged, including belts with the classic covenant chain imagery of a series of links between an Indigenous mountain and a European vessel.<renvoi id="re1no25" idref="no25" typeref="note">25</renvoi> The objective of these treaties was to establish duties of care and trust by forging with the Crown something like the kind of spiritual harmony and kinship that brought normative unity within and between their own communities.<renvoi id="re1no26" idref="no26" typeref="note">26</renvoi> There was a rhyme and reason to the covenant chain constitution. Consider, for example, the written account of a speech given by an unnamed Mohawk orator at a covenant chain council:</alinea>
        <bloccitation>
          <alinea>The <marquage typemarq="italique">Mohawks</marquage> Speaker said, “Where shall I
            seek the Chain of Peace? Where shall I find it but upon our Path? And whither doth our
            Path lead us, but into this House? This is a House of Peace;” after this he sang all the
            Links of the Chain over.<renvoi id="re1no27" idref="no27" typeref="note">27</renvoi></alinea>
        </bloccitation>
        <alinea>This brief passage has a sort of poetic power to it. It may only be the summary of
          the speaker’s words and songs; however, the idea that one could sing “all the Links of the
          Chain over”, that the treaty relationship could be expressed through song, is significant.
          There was, as the wampum belts often show, a linking of arms, a physical and spiritual
          joining of people together. To invoke the language I have been using this evening, if I
          may, these societies were deeply pluralistic in the sense that laws did not emanate from a
          single sovereign commander. Each individual or community could go their own way should
          they wish to, and yet precisely because of this sense of freedom (or pluralism) there was
          a need to establish a deep sense of normative unity through a legal narrative that
          captured rhyme and reason in a very distinctive sense, one that bound peoples who were
          equally free in relations of care and trust.</alinea></para><para id="pa21"><no>21</no><alinea> Perhaps we can say, then, that rhyme is a part of each of the three sets of legal traditions now found in Canada—common law, civilian, and indigenous. Of course, these suggestions will seem rather lofty and detached from the hard realities of the Canadian constitution today. But they will, I hope, provide us with some direction in due course. Before developing these ideas further, however, it is time to address the ideas of agonism and agonistic constitutionalism.</alinea></para><para id="pa22"><no>22</no><alinea> To this end, it may be helpful to return to Isaiah Berlin. Berlin did not just think that basic values, like liberty and democracy, at times conflict. He seemed to think that fundamental values are ultimately incommensurable or rationally incomparable. Without a common measure or scale to compare liberty and democracy, for example, there can be no rational discourse about how to resolve competing claims about the two. To compare a claim about liberty with one about democracy is like asking whether a metre is bigger than a litre. In these circumstances, there can be no principled reconciliation of the values, but only at best a contingent rapprochement between opposing views.</alinea></para><para id="pa23"><no>23</no><alinea> Or at least this was the reading of Berlin adopted by another influential Oxford philosopher, John Gray. Taking Berlin’s views on incommensurability to an extreme conclusion, Gray argued that “[the] rationalist and universalist tradition of liberal political philosophy runs aground, along with the rest of the Enlightenment project, on the reef of value pluralism.”<renvoi id="re1no28" idref="no28" typeref="note">28</renvoi> Value pluralism implies not just opposing accounts of value between individuals, but also between entire cultures and cultural traditions. Once it is clear that competing visions of value between individuals and communities and indeed entire cultural traditions are incommensurable, then, Gray argues, it follows that they cannot be resolved through any “rational” method, including any “jurisprudential” or “legalist” method.<renvoi id="re1no29" idref="no29" typeref="note">29</renvoi> Gray thus insists that value pluralism leads us to accept what he calls—with echoes, I think, of Carl Schmitt—“<marquage typemarq="italique">the primacy of the political</marquage>”, meaning that choices about rights and values can only be made through politics and political struggle and never on the basis of principle.<renvoi id="re1no30" idref="no30" typeref="note">30</renvoi> This is, we may say, the legal and political philosophy of the fox. Berlin’s liberalism was, in fact, Gray insisted, “agonistic liberalism”, a liberalism that depended entirely on political and cultural contingency and not reason.<renvoi id="re1no31" idref="no31" typeref="note">31</renvoi></alinea></para><para id="pa24"><no>24</no><alinea> It is not my objective this evening to consider whether Gray was right to call Berlin an agonistic liberal. In fact, one of my new McGill colleagues, Daniel Weinstock, writes convincingly that Gray was very wrong about Berlin.<renvoi id="re1no32" idref="no32" typeref="note">32</renvoi> I am instead interested in the more general claim that the fact of pluralism means that we must accept value pluralism and thus also agonism. I am also interested in the troubling question of what agonism means for our commitment to the value of legality, because I think legality implies normative unity.

        <alinea>Depending upon how it is read, this statement might also be difficult to reconcile

          peoples within Quebec’s boundaries. These appear to be diametrically opposing
          constitutional visions. If disagreement is this deep and is grounded in the reality of
          fundamental differences in cultural and national identities that demand and deserve to be

But it also has a reformative or redemptive edge too. In arguing that the assertion of Indigenous legal traditions in Canada today may be seen to subvert or disrupt established constitutional assumptions in Canada, John Borrows invokes the theoretical insights of James Tully. In particular, Borrows invokes Tully’s exploration of the critical unbalancing of received political and legal notions and the patterns of domination they instantiate, a process that, Tully says, enables us “to see our island of disputation and negotiation” not as a utopian process of rational and transparent communication, but rather “as it is, in the rough and agonistic sea of relations of power.”<renvoi id="re1no42" idref="no42" typeref="note">42</renvoi> From relations of domination and power and the resistance that disrupts them cannot emerge a singular vision of constitutionalism, though workable compromises may be possible. As Jeremy Webber argues, Canadians have succeeded in sustaining a polity that does not require a single constitutional vision of its members; with the claims by Indigenous nations and Quebec nationalists in mind, he observes that “even questions of sovereignty, are held in abeyance.”<renvoi id="re1no43" idref="no43" typeref="note">43</renvoi> Webber, who also relies upon Tully’s work, writes as follows: </alinea>
        <bloccitation>

            constitutionalism</marquage>: a constitutionalism in which contending positions are seen
            to be essential to the society, animating it, and where these positions are not neatly
            contained within a comprehensive, overarching theory. ... It takes the diversity of the
            country as it finds it, and treats the development of its constitution as something that
            must proceed day by day, not through the fiat of a closed set of founding fathers or
            their privileged successors.<renvoi id="re1no44" idref="no44" typeref="note">44</renvoi></alinea>
        </bloccitation>
        <alinea>Webber observes that the Supreme Court of Canada has, in effect, adopted a kind of
          agonistic constitutionalism, by seeking, where possible, to address constitutional
          conflict not by definitive, substantive rulings about rights and duties, but by crafting
          procedural and substantive principles designed merely to inform, shape, discipline, and
          channel on-going dialogue between political actors who appear to hold fundamentally
          opposed visions of the constitution.</alinea></para><para id="pa28"><no>28</no><alinea> The Canadian school of agonistic constitutionalism offers powerful insights into governance within divided societies. Relations of domination should be disrupted.

Each of these propositions seems right.<renvoi id="re1no45" idref="no45" typeref="note">45</renvoi> And yet, I remain concerned about a theoretical framework for considering the experience of constitutionalism that is based on the agonistic assumption of radical moral indeterminacy and the privileging of power over principle.</alinea></para><para id="pa29"><no>29</no><alinea> It is fair to say that Canadian constitutional agonists are not of the Mouffe-Schmitt kind.<renvoi id="re1no46" idref="no46" typeref="note">46</renvoi> Tully’s agonism is a kinder and gentler agonism.<renvoi id="re1no47" idref="no47" typeref="note">47</renvoi> His inspiration is not Schmitt but Michel Foucault. He invokes Foucault’s argument that the very idea of power implies the existence of freedom, that one can only exercise power over people who have some degree of freedom, and hence freedom itself is only to be understood through the existence and response to power. “Rather than speaking of an essential freedom,” writes Foucault in a passage upon which Tully relies, “it would be better to speak of an ‘agonism’—of a relationship which is at the same time reciprocal incitation and struggle, less of a face-to-face confrontation which paralyzes both sides than a permanent provocation.”<renvoi id="re1no48" idref="no48" typeref="note">48</renvoi> </alinea></para><para id="pa30"><no>30</no><alinea> Yet, for this “permanent provocation” to produce the kind of redemptive effect for the marginalized and the oppressed that Tully hopes for, it is necessary, Tully himself says, to imagine “diverse forms of citizen participation involv[ing] agonic dialogues and negotiations in which <marquage typemarq="italique">audi alteram partem</marquage> (always listen to the other side) is the immanent rule of reciprocity.”<renvoi id="re1no49" idref="no49" typeref="note">49</renvoi> In this way, “the rules of intersubjective recognition [may] be open to question and subject to the interplay of reasons and re-descriptions among free and equal citizens”, including both “multicultural citizens” and “suppressed nations and indigenous peoples.”<renvoi id="re1no50" idref="no50" typeref="note">50</renvoi> Tully’s agonic dialogue needs a normative framework premised upon a classic principle of natural justice or due process, or, in other words, the rule of law, that is in turn premised upon an underlying commitment to the idea that people are equally free. Agonistic dialogue seems to require a decidedly non-agonistic constitutionalism. Has the hedgehog infiltrated the pluralist camp?</alinea></para><para id="pa31"><no>31</no><alinea> It could be said that these framework requirements merely structure or contain power politics loosely and that <marquage typemarq="italique">real</marquage> agonism flourishes within. If only form and substance could be so neatly divided. Once a respectful (agonic) dialogue unfolds, once, that is, the sides in a relationship of power and domination begin to listen to each other, what will be said? It seems to me almost inevitable that, at some point in this deliberative process, one side will try to explain to the other that maintaining the unbalanced relationship of power involves moral incoherence—that the situation cannot be defended by the other side unless they abandon convictions or ideals that they, and indeed those on both sides, cherish; that the continued acceptance of the status quo shows their convictions as a whole to be in a state of discordance, indeed a shambles; that there is no <marquage typemarq="italique">reason</marquage> to the way the positions that they try to defend fit together, but also no <marquage typemarq="italique">rhyme</marquage>. The implicit lesson of the renaissance humanists and the old common lawyers is that truth is something toward which we work through an attempt to show, through discourse or disputation, how the specific or concrete convictions about value we do share or the established cases we do accept—there must be some—may be seen to hold together as coherent and unified in light of a theory of more abstract or general value which they presuppose. </alinea></para><para id="pa32"><no>32</no><alinea> This style of normative discourse is ancient, though it is now often associated with and also obscured by its principal modern champion, Ronald Dworkin, who calls it “interpretation”.<renvoi id="re1no51" idref="no51" typeref="note">51</renvoi> It is ‘interpretivism’ of some kind, whether Dworkinian or not we leave to the side for now, that, I think, offers a compelling alternative to agonism that allows us to reconcile normative unity with pluralism. Dworkin’s account does provide some useful starting points. On Dworkin’s view of the unity of value, truth about value is not anchored in some foundation or source external to the interpretive process; rather, different accounts of truth are presented and defended through a process of critical reflection involving the constant oscillation between concrete and general in search of equilibrium. The great insight offered by this style of normative discourse is, in my view, that it is a thoroughly non-foundational or “circular” theory of value generally, and it implies a “circular” theory of legality or the concept of law in particular, one in which there is no extra-legal or pre-legal fact or command or norm that holds the law together.<renvoi id="re1no52" idref="no52" typeref="note">52</renvoi></alinea></para><para id="pa33"><no>33</no><alinea> However, there are (at least) two things missing or under-emphasized in Dworkin’s interpretive account of normative unity. The first is that rhyme, though present, is not held up as a special feature of interpretation. If the interpretive process yields truth at all, it will not be by virtue of formal logic or analytical purity. Values may well be, as agonists say, incommensurable as a matter of strict reason, because no scale or measure exists to compare them scientifically. But humans are not machines and we should not expect their values to be explicable through mathematical formulae. The interpretive process is an art not a science, and a good argument about value will be, at some level, an aesthetically attractive arrangement of ideas—one that manifests harmony, equity, proportion, or <marquage typemarq="italique">elegantia</marquage>.</alinea></para><para id="pa34"><no>34</no><alinea> Second, the idea of normative unity must of course address the reality of pluralism. How can an interpretive or circular theory of law, with its incessant drive for normative unity, integrity, or coherence, account for and accommodate—let alone nurture and celebrate—the reality of a pluralistic society? There is much in Dworkin’s work suggestive of a monolithic liberal legalism: he does, after all, refer to law’s <marquage typemarq="italique">empire</marquage> and he imagines a superhuman judge Hercules who can find <marquage typemarq="italique">the</marquage> right answer to any legal question.<renvoi id="re1no53" idref="no53" typeref="note">53</renvoi> It all sounds very imperialistic. I am reminded at this point about an exchange that I witnessed in a seminar led by Dworkin at Oxford (he was, for a time, my doctoral supervisor and so naturally I attended all of his seminars). The discussion focused upon the very issues we are now addressing, and a student, no doubt a Canadian and perhaps a Quebecer, asked whether the Quebec sign laws, mandating the use of the French language on commercial signs, could be reconciled with liberal values.<renvoi id="re1no54" idref="no54" typeref="note">54</renvoi> My recollection is that Dworkin was far too dismissive of the possibility in answering no.</alinea></para><para id="pa35"><no>35</no><alinea> There are two reasons to think that he was wrong, on the basis of his own theory of interpretation, to be so dismissive. First, his is a circular theory. There is no sovereign root to the law or to any value, and values that are freed from a positivist foundation may have a distinctive ability to accommodate difference without forgoing the commitment to unity. The unity of value to emerge through interpretation must accept all differences that are necessary to accept in order to make coherent sense of a world full of diversity. Whether this approach might justify restrictive laws to protect a linguistic minority is, of course, still an open question—but it is an <marquage typemarq="italique">open</marquage> question. A commitment to normative unity is hardly a commitment to normative sameness.</alinea></para><para id="pa36"><no>36</no><alinea> Indeed, from my limited understanding of Indigenous legal traditions, I get the sense that
          these traditions assume that respect for deep difference and the search for ultimate
          harmony are twin objectives sensibly pursued together. On this point, it may be helpful to
          contrast Indigenous and non-Indigenous images of the constitution as a (so-called) “living
          tree”. In the hands of non-Indigenous judges, the living-tree constitution consists of an
          impressive set of branches and leaves, alive and growing, but all emanating from one
          single trunk.<renvoi id="re1no55" idref="no55" typeref="note">55</renvoi> It is a very linear account of law.
          Indeed, it is arguably a positivist conception of law according to which every legal norm
          is traceable back to a single originating phenomenon that is itself outside the law,
          whether Austin’s sovereign, Kelsen’s <marquage typemarq="italique">grundnorm</marquage>,
          or Hart’s rule of recognition.<renvoi id="re1no56" idref="no56" typeref="note">56</renvoi> It is a conception of law
          that reduces constitutional pluralism to a system of delegated and subordinate
          constitutional powers. The Great Tree of Peace central to Haudenosaunee traditions of
          constitutionalism, in contrast, places equal emphasis on the branches <marquage typemarq="italique">and</marquage> the complex network of roots under the tree that are
          also growing and extending, spreading, according to the tradition, the ideal of
          peace.<renvoi id="re1no57" idref="no57" typeref="note">57</renvoi> This tree has no real beginning. It draws
          distinctive peoples to its shade where they may meet in council. It was under the tree
          that, according to one version of the tradition, the chiefs of different nations,
          themselves “symbolized as trees”, bound themselves together “by taking hold of each
          other’s hands firmly and forming a circle,” a “circle of unity”.<renvoi id="re1no58" idref="no58" typeref="note">58</renvoi> This is a much more complicated constitutional arrangement, for it lacks a
          single sovereign root. However, it does suggest that normative unity can exist even when
          an exclusive or singular conception of sovereignty does not.</alinea></para><para id="pa37"><no>37</no><alinea> Second, we need to attend to the distinction Dworkin draws between external and internal skepticism about value. Value pluralism is a form of external skepticism. It involves stepping out of the interpretive circle and passing judgment on the process, concluding that there can never be any truth about any value, only a plurality of different opinions or traditions all contingent upon culture or politics or power. Slavery and genocide are evil on this view—for us, perhaps, but perhaps not for others. If this is value pluralism, Dworkin was right to reject it. We all should. However, this does not end the matter. Pluralism may itself be reconceived as a value with its own truth and normative implications. In other words, if <marquage typemarq="italique">value pluralism</marquage> is exchanged for a conception of <marquage typemarq="italique">pluralism as a value,</marquage> then we can re-enter the interpretive circle and begin to construct interpretations about how, in specific situations, pluralism may be reconciled with the other constitutional values we cherish. If we can figure out how to engage in this interpretive process—if we accept pluralism as a value in place of value pluralism—then I think we will have captured the pluralistic hedgehog.</alinea></para><para id="pa38"><no>38</no><alinea> An interpretive theory of the normative unity of constitutional value permits us to develop and defend accounts of constitutionalism that seem true, right, or best to us, but it does not guarantee convergence of ideas among different interpretations. It is a mechanism for ongoing constitutional discourse, and, in part, of constructive <marquage typemarq="italique">dis</marquage>agreement; agreement and acceptance will emerge, if at all, through arguments aimed at truth rather than at agreement and acceptance as such.<renvoi id="re1no59" idref="no59" typeref="note">59</renvoi> The theory does not take an a priori position on whom in our system should, as a practical matter, determine which interpretation shall be, for the time being, legally enforced. Jeremy Webber is entirely right to say that a judicial pronouncement on deeply contested constitutional fundamentals may, on many occasions, hinder rather than help the search for just relationships.<renvoi id="re1no60" idref="no60" typeref="note">60</renvoi> But I remain worried about characterizing the space left by courts for dialogue and deliberation between political actors and citizens as one defined by agonism. The ensuing dialogue will go better, I think, if we begin with the assumption that we are all striving to show each other the best meaning of the constitution, as if there really is some truth to the matter, rather than just incomparable or incommensurable opinions to be compromised through political struggle. We do better if we accept and listen to Indigenous claims, for example, as if they really are claims about justice that must be accommodated in a way that shows all of our convictions about value as something more than a random or arbitrary jumble. Despite our intense differences, we should not be afraid of the ideal of normative unity. Indeed, the ideal of normative unity in constitutional value is what allows us to insist upon the <marquage typemarq="italique">right,</marquage> rather than just the fact of difference.</alinea></para><para id="pa39"><no>39</no><alinea> There <marquage typemarq="italique">is </marquage>an answer about how to accommodate competing nationalisms within Canada, as well as the many other visions that compete for ascendancy, but we can only find it by engaging in an interpretive enterprise that seeks to show how our conclusions cohere with the general values of equality and integrity that these conclusions presuppose. A Hercules could find the answer—but fortunately such a mythical creature does not exist. For us, the best we can do is to nurture an interpretive discourse that allows the constitution to evolve, in the incremental fashion that ordinary legal interpretation enables, with the belief that our sense of integrity and justice and our appreciation for the diversity and the unity of views about equality and respect for others will deepen and converge over time and with experience. A state of constitutional harmony that respects the equal freedom to be different is just over the horizon, but we can get there only by forging the best path possible for the part of the journey that we confront today.</alinea></para><para id="pa40"><no>40</no><alinea> Rod Macdonald ended his inaugural lecture by reciting several passages from the poems of F.R.

          who pursue a “politics of compulsion” over one of principle, though, it is also
          acknowledged, that members of this group perceive “the potential for actual enjoyment,
          liberation and hope in aspects of the bleak coercive political world” (see Marc Stears,
