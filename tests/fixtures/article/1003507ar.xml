There have been continuous attempts to broaden the concept of                    translation, most notably by theorists such as Toury (1980), Sallis (2002), and,                    most recently, Hermans (2007) and Tymoczko (2007). The Japanese scholar Naoki                    Sakai has also conducted a radical interrogation of the model of communication                    upon which the concept of translation is built, and a critique of the notion of                    translation as communication (Sakai 2006). </alinea></para><para id="pa2"><no>2</no><alinea>There is one common strand running through the works of all these theorists.                    Whether they approach the concept from an abstract philosophical or a historical                    angle, these theorists have tried to take translation beyond the confines set by                    definitions that are primarily informed by linguistic theories of translation.                    Catford’s definition comes immediately to mind, “the replacement of textual                    material in one language (SL) by equivalent textual material in another language                    (TL)” (Catford 1965: 20). These theorists have also tried to understand                    translation not as an ahistorical and ideal notion but as one grounded in time                    and space, in the concrete circumstances of production, and as encompassing the                    diverse range and specificities of the products accepted as <marquage typemarq="italique">translation</marquage> by their users. In the words of                    Toury, translation is “any target language text which is presented or regarded                    as such (i.e., as translation) within the target system itself, on whatever                    grounds” (Toury 1982: 27; 1980: 14, 37, 43-45). According to Hermans (2007,                    Chapter One “The End”), the existence of texts authenticated as translations by                    international institutions or by religious authorities in the past shows that                    equivalence can be declared rather than realized in the fullness of a linguistic                    replacement. Tymoczko (2007), taking into account products accepted as                    translation now and in the past, and having examined the meanings of different                    local terms for <marquage typemarq="italique">translation</marquage> in                    different cultures, decides to introduce a new conceptualization of translation.                    She finds the classical concept of categorization inadequate for her purpose,                    even the looser boundaries set by the prototype theory of translation is too                    restrictive, and she argues that translation is a cluster concept, i.e., a                    concept with open boundaries.</alinea></para><para id="pa3"><no>3</no><alinea>In China, because of political upheavals in the 1960s and 1970s, and the                    lack of academic status for translation studies as an independent discipline,                    the situation was, and still is, different.<renvoi id="re1no2" idref="no2" typeref="note">2</renvoi> The                    main trend has been the introduction, through translation, of Western                    translation theories to help translation scholars become acquainted with                    approaches towards translation that are different from the prescriptive one                    represented by <marquage typemarq="italique">xin</marquage> 信, <marquage typemarq="italique">da</marquage> 達, <marquage typemarq="italique">ya</marquage> 雅 (usually translated as faithfulness, comprehensibility, and                    elegance).

More often than not, it was faulted for being                    impressionistic, anecdotal, and lacking in theoretical vigour. But where                    attempts to conceptualize translation are concerned, I think that Chinese                    discourse on translation provides clear evidence of past efforts to respond to                    the realities of translation that had emerged at different Chinese historical                    periods by offering new (as opposed to established) explications of <marquage typemarq="italique">fanyi</marquage> 翻譯 (translation). In this paper,<renvoi id="re1no3" idref="no3" typeref="note">3</renvoi> I shall focus on a number of texts taken from                    Chinese discourse on translation, and show how they produce different                    conceptualizations of <marquage typemarq="italique">fanyi</marquage> 翻譯                    (translation).

Qian Zhongshu 錢鍾書 (1910-1998) was a                    writer, an essayist, a man of great learning and a renowned scholar in                    comparative literature. Lin Shu 林紓 (1852-1924) is one of the best known                    translators of Western literary works in the history of translation in China. A                    monolingual who worked with his collaborators by turning their oral renditions                    into written Chinese, Lin was known for his stylistic accomplishments and                    enjoyed a higher reputation than his collaborators. </alinea></para><para id="pa5"><no>5</no><alinea>In this essay, Qian cites the authority of the early                        2<exposant>nd</exposant> century scholar Xu Shen 許慎 (ca. 58–ca. 147), who                    compiled the first comprehensive dictionary of Chinese characters <marquage typemarq="italique">Shuowen jiezi</marquage> 說文解字 (hereafter <marquage typemarq="italique">Shuowen</marquage>),<renvoi id="re1no4" idref="no4" typeref="note">4</renvoi>                    and says that in that dictionary, there is an entry – the character 囮 (<marquage typemarq="italique">e</marquage>) – which elucidates the concept <marquage typemarq="italique">yi</marquage> 譯<renvoi id="re1no5" idref="no5" typeref="note">5</renvoi>                    (translation) and which is rich in interpretive significance: “‘<marquage typemarq="italique">é</marquage>’ 囮, translate/translation ‘<marquage typemarq="italique">yì</marquage>’ 譯, derived from “<marquage typemarq="italique">wéi</marquage>” 口, ‘<marquage typemarq="italique">huà</marquage>’ 化 is phonophoric (the sound-bearing component).

It is clearly a metaphorical connection, with the                    transmission of the words of the tribes in the four quarters working “much in                    the same way as the bird-decoy (<marquage typemarq="italique">niaomei</marquage>                    鳥媒 [literally, bird match-maker]) <marquage typemarq="souligne">entices</marquage> (<marquage typemarq="italique">yòu</marquage> 誘)                        birds”<renvoi id="re1no7" idref="no7" typeref="note">7</renvoi> (好比 “鳥媒”對 “禽鳥” 所施的引 “誘”) (Qian 1979:                    62, translated by the author).

If a                    translation leaves no trace of the strain and awkwardness caused by the                    differences between the source and target languages, and if the flavour and feel                    of the source text is fully preserved, then such a translation can be said to                    have reached <marquage typemarq="italique">huajing</marquage> 化境 – the state of                    total transformation. Qian also says that in order to reach the state of total                    transformation, a translation should be so faithful to the original that it                    would not read like a translation, because a literary work in its own language                    will never read like a work that has undergone translation. </alinea></para><para id="pa9"><no>9</no><alinea>This state of transformation, however, is not easy to attain (Qian 1979:                    64). In Qian’s view, misrepresentation (<marquage typemarq="italique">é</marquage> 訛) is inevitable, due to all sorts of reasons. But instead of                    speaking disparagingly about misrepresentation, he says that there are different                    types of misrepresentations and they are not all bad. Through an analysis of Lin                    Shu’s translations, Qian distinguishes two types of misrepresentations. One                    comprises careless mistakes made by Lin. The other type comprises embellishments                    and compensations (Qian 1979: 67-70) which can add colour, verve, drama, and                    humour to the translation (Qian 1979: 69). They were Lin Shu’s <marquage typemarq="italique">contributions</marquage> to the text he was translating.                    While Qian says that these interventions should not be encouraged in works of                    translation, he also remarks that they could provide inspiration for anyone                    interested in rhetoric and the art of composition. Qian even says that a                    translator who is also a writer, or fancies himself to be one, could hardly                    resist the urge to act as the original author’s “best friend and severest critic                    (諍友)” when he comes across passages that are weak and need improvement (Qian                    1979: 72).</alinea></para><para id="pa10"><no>10</no><alinea>Because misrepresentation is inevitable, the characters <marquage typemarq="italique">mei</marquage> 媒 (medium) and <marquage typemarq="italique">you</marquage> 誘 (entice) also take on new meanings.                    Generally speaking, a translation serves as the medium of transmission                        (<marquage typemarq="italique">mei </marquage>媒), bringing the foreign work                    to readers and enticing them (<marquage typemarq="italique">you</marquage> 誘) to                    become attached to the work without having to learn the foreign language. When                    that is accomplished, the translation will function like a match-maker                        (<marquage typemarq="italique">mei</marquage> 媒) and bring about a “literary                    romance between nations” (國與國之間締結了文學姻緣) (Qian 1979: 64, translated by the                    author). But when a translation comes to life through daring acts of                    misrepresentation, some readers would sense that the translation is misleading                    and their curiosity to know what the original is like would lead them (<marquage typemarq="italique">you</marquage> 誘) to learn the foreign language so that                    they can read the original for themselves. That way, the translation will also                    have functioned like a match-maker (<marquage typemarq="italique">mei</marquage>                    媒), but in the sense that it makes itself redundant, just as a matchmaker will                    retreat from the scene once the courtship begins. As for a translation that is                    riddled with careless mistakes (<marquage typemarq="italique">e</marquage> 訛),                    it will lose the readers’ interest and hence destroy both itself and the foreign                    work. </alinea></para><para id="pa11"><no>11</no><alinea>This configuration of characters (<marquage typemarq="italique">yi</marquage> 譯, <marquage typemarq="italique">you</marquage> 誘, <marquage typemarq="italique">mei</marquage> 媒, <marquage typemarq="italique">e</marquage> 訛, <marquage typemarq="italique">hua</marquage> 化) presents to                    us a view of translation that is related to but also different from the view of                    translation predicated on faithfulness (<marquage typemarq="italique">xin                    </marquage>信). It is related, because the emphasis on <marquage typemarq="italique">huajing</marquage> 化境 – the state of total                    transformation attained through the preservation of the flavour and feel of the                    source text – can be taken as an elucidation of the theme of faithfulness                        (<marquage typemarq="italique">xin</marquage> 信). And yet it is also                    different: because although Qian upholds <marquage typemarq="italique">huajing</marquage> 化境 (total transformation) as the ideal of translation,                    he is not prescriptive about it. Certainly he does not insist on faithfulness at                    the level of words and syntax. What is more, he accepts translation for what it                    often is in reality – misrepresentation, distortion, disguised composition of a                    parasitic nature, or enhanced performance. He even entertains the possibility of                    translation as transgression, as re-writing, and as betrayal (reference is made                    in Qian’s essay to the Italian saying “<marquage typemarq="italique">Traduttore</marquage>, <marquage typemarq="italique">traditore</marquage>,”                    “The translator is a traitor [翻譯者即反逆者]”) (Qian 1979: 63). The implicit point is                    that the subservience of the translator, and the concomitant notion of                    faithfulness, is not absolute or axiomatic. The translator can manipulate the                    source, betray it, play with it, display traces of his own creativity, be highly                    visible, and be appreciated for it.</alinea></para><para id="pa12"><no>12</no><alinea>The theoretical significance of Qian’s essay has not been fully explored in                    Chinese translation studies, and definitely not in translation studies in other                    places. All too often, the idea of <marquage typemarq="italique">huajing</marquage> 化境 (total transformation) was lifted from the essay and                    added to the configuration formed by<marquage typemarq="italique"> xin                    </marquage>信 (faithfulness), <marquage typemarq="italique">da </marquage>達                    (comprehensibility), <marquage typemarq="italique">ya </marquage>雅 (elegance).                    The result is, one might say, the taming of the shrewd. </alinea></para><para id="pa13"><no>13</no><alinea>But in fact, Qian’s essay has radical energy. One can use the view of                    translation conveyed by his configuration of terms to overthrow the view of                    translation as an act of linguistic exchange predicated on faithfulness, which                    has been the dominant view in China, especially since the beginning of the                    twentieth century. But that would be replacing one dogma with another. A better                    way to release the radical energy of Qian’s essay is to interpret it as                    affirming the possibility of alternative views of translation and of alternative                    ways of theorizing about translation. Earlier on I asked the question of what                    interpretive feats have been performed by Qian. Apart from those described in                    the above paragraphs, Qian’s greatest interpretive feat lies in the way he                    theorizes translation from the entry <marquage typemarq="italique">e</marquage>                    囮 in <marquage typemarq="italique">Shuowen</marquage> and the accompanying                    annotations. To fully appreciate this feat, let us first analyze the logic of                    Qian’s argument. The basic premise of Qian argument is that since <marquage typemarq="italique">e</marquage> 囮 means <marquage typemarq="italique">yi</marquage> 譯 (translation), what has been provided in the explications                    and annotations of <marquage typemarq="italique">e</marquage> 囮 is equally valid                    for <marquage typemarq="italique">yi</marquage> 譯 and Qian can thus select from                    this lot of material the key points for theorization. Interestingly, however,                    one piece of information given in one of the annotations has not featured in                    Qian’s discussion, even though that annotation is included in the source cited                    by Qian, <marquage typemarq="italique">A Compendium of Annotations and                        Exegetical Commentaries on Shuowen Jiezi</marquage> (說文解字詁林). In that                    annotation supplied by Wang Yun 王筠 (1784-1854), it is pointed out that even                    though <marquage typemarq="italique">yi</marquage> 譯 (translation) is the                    original meaning of <marquage typemarq="italique">e </marquage>囮, that meaning                    has been lost and <marquage typemarq="italique">e</marquage> 囮 has functioned as                    a phonetic loan to refer to the use of bird decoys (quoted in Ding 1966: 2737).                    It is also significant that the Qing dynasty scholar Duan Yucai 段玉裁 (1735-1815),                    who collated what even now is considered to be one of the two most authoritative                    annotated editions of <marquage typemarq="italique">Shuowen</marquage> (the                    other one being the one used by Qian), did not even include the meaning                        <marquage typemarq="italique">yi </marquage>譯 (translation) under the entry                        <marquage typemarq="italique">e </marquage>囮 in his edition, <marquage typemarq="italique">Shuowen Jiezizhu</marquage> (說文解字注). The omission of                    these two points by Qian shows that his interest in the <marquage typemarq="italique">Shuowen</marquage> material pertaining to <marquage typemarq="italique">yi</marquage> 譯 (translation) is less philological than                    literary. Qian might have identified the etymological link between <marquage typemarq="italique">e</marquage> 囮 and <marquage typemarq="italique">yi</marquage> 譯 with the sharp eye and detective instinct of an erudite                    scholar, but the reading and discursive strategy he applies to that dictionary                    entry reflects the imaginative sensibilities of <marquage typemarq="italique">a                        student of poetic diction</marquage>. Rather than dismissing the character                    entry <marquage typemarq="italique">e</marquage> 囮 and the related annotations                    because <marquage typemarq="italique">e</marquage> 囮 has already lost the                    meaning of <marquage typemarq="italique">yi</marquage> 譯 (at least since the                    Qing dynasty), and rather than focusing his attention exclusively on the                    meanings of <marquage typemarq="italique">yi</marquage> 譯 as listed in Chinese                    dictionaries through the ages, Qian allows himself to be enticed, as it were, by                    the word-decoy; he turns this piece of etymological curiosity into material for                    theorization, and produces a conceptualization of translation that is                    intellectually exciting not only for its content but also for the mode of                    thinking that underlies it. As I shall show in the following pages, it is a mode                    of thinking which can help us read historical records of Chinese discourse on                    translation with a new pair of eyes, build fresh connections amongst texts, tap                    unexpected interpretive possibilities and reach a new understanding of past                    endeavours to make sense of the concept of translation</alinea></para></section1><section1 id="s1n3"><no>3</no><titre>2.

To quote from the annotations                    of the authoritative Kong Yingda 孔穎達 (574-648),<renvoi id="re1no11" idref="no11" typeref="note">11</renvoi> who was entrusted by Emperor Taizong 太宗 of the Tang dynasty to                    form a committee of scholars to prepare a commentary on the Five Classics,                        <marquage typemarq="italique">ji</marquage>寄 meant “entrusted with the                    languages of the east” (寄者，寄付東方之言) (<marquage typemarq="italique">Liji                        Zhengyi</marquage> 1982: 1338, translated by the author). In addition, Kong                    also explained <marquage typemarq="italique">ji</marquage> 寄 as “officials who                    comprehend and transmit the languages of the east.” Furthermore, he took                        <marquage typemarq="italique">ji</marquage> 寄 as a verb meaning ‘transmit.’                    (通傳東方之語官謂之曰寄，言傳寄外內言語) (<marquage typemarq="italique">Liji Zhengyi</marquage>                    1982: 1338, translated by the author). The two meanings of <marquage typemarq="italique">ji </marquage>寄, i.e., ‘to entrust’ and ‘to transmit,’                    when taken together, suggest that <marquage typemarq="italique">ji</marquage>                    寄was a government official entrusted by the King to transmit His words/message                    to the tribes in the East, and to bring their messages back. <marquage typemarq="italique">ji</marquage> 寄, in short, is a trusted transmitter. And                    ‘trusted transmission’ would certainly be considered a distinctive feature of                        <marquage typemarq="italique">fanyi </marquage>翻譯 (translation). </alinea></para><para id="pa18"><no>18</no><alinea>The character <marquage typemarq="italique">xiang</marquage> 象 is even                    richer in meaning.

It also means “officials who comprehend and                    transmit the languages of the south.” As a verb, it means ‘to imitate’                    (通傳南方語官謂之曰象者，言放象外內之言) (<marquage typemarq="italique">Liji Zhengyi</marquage>                    1982: 1338, translated by the author). A further explanation provided by Kong                    Yingda is “render in likeness the languages of the south” (象者，象似南方之言) (<marquage typemarq="italique">Liji Zhengyi</marquage> 1982: 1338, translated by the                    author). The connection between “elephant” and “the languages of the south” is                    to be traced to the relation between the Zhou dynasty (c.                        11<exposant>th</exposant> century-771 BCE) and her southern neighbours, one                    of which was the country of Jiaozhi 交趾 (present day Vietnam). Because Jiaozhi                    used to present elephants and elephant tusks as tributes to the Zhou kings,                        <marquage typemarq="italique">xiang</marquage> 象 could well have been used                    as a metonymy for “officials who comprehend and transmit the languages of the                    south.” As a matter of fact, <marquage typemarq="italique">xiangxu</marquage> 象胥                        (<marquage typemarq="italique">xiang</marquage>-functionaries) was the                    collective name for these minor officials.

He said that due to phonological similarity between the character                        <marquage typemarq="italique">di</marquage> 鞮 and the character <marquage typemarq="italique">zhi</marquage> 知, <marquage typemarq="italique">Didi</marquage> 狄鞮 meant “know the language of the <marquage typemarq="italique">Di</marquage> tribes and transmit it for the purpose of                    communicating between them and China” (狄鞮者 […] 謂通傳夷狄之語與中國相知) (<marquage typemarq="italique">Liji Zhengyi</marquage> 1982: 1338, translated by the                    author). In recent decades, however, Kong’s annotation has been challenged.                    Another interpretation has been offered: due to phonological borrowing and other                    reasons, <marquage typemarq="italique">Didi </marquage>狄鞮 was probably the                    Chinese transliteration of the word <marquage typemarq="italique"><marquage typemarq="souligne">tilqi</marquage></marquage> in the Uighur language,                    and <marquage typemarq="italique"><marquage typemarq="souligne">tilqi</marquage></marquage> was similar in meaning and structure to the                    Chinese term <marquage typemarq="italique">sheren</marquage> 舌人 (literally                    “tongue-men,” meaning “interpreters”) (Maitiniyazi 1994: 12). Irrespective of                    which is the correct meaning of <marquage typemarq="italique">Didi                    </marquage>狄鞮, the point to note is that the two meanings complement rather than                    contradict each other. They also complement rather than contradict the meanings                    of the other characters just discussed. </alinea></para><para id="pa21"><no>21</no><alinea>We now come to the character <marquage typemarq="italique">yi</marquage> 譯,                    which gained currency and displaced the other three terms in the course of the                    Han dynasty (206 BCE-220 CE) and subsequent centuries. According to Kong                    Yingda’s annotation, it means “to state in an orderly manner and be conversant                    in the words of the country and those outside the country” (譯，陳也，謂陳說外內之言)                        (<marquage typemarq="italique">Liji Zhengyi</marquage> 1982: 1338,                    translated by the author).<renvoi id="re1no12" idref="no12" typeref="note">12</renvoi> Another annotation,                    provided by Kong’s contemporary Jia Gongyan 賈公彥 (7<exposant>th</exposant>                    century annotator), “‘to translate’ means ‘to exchange,’ that is to say, to                    change and replace the words of one language by another to achieve mutual                    understanding” (譯即易，謂換易言語使相解也) (Jia 1983: 620, translated by the                    author).</alinea></para><para id="pa22"><no>22</no><alinea>Since all the four terms have meanings, very rich meanings, it is necessary                    to affirm the validity of a reading other than the one enshrined in Chinese                    scholarship. All through the centuries, the passage from the <marquage typemarq="italique">Book of Rites</marquage> has been read as a historical                    record of the official titles of government functionaries responsible for                    communicating and maintaining diplomatic relations with the neighbours of China                    in ancient times. There is no denying the accuracy of this reading, but I would                    argue that the passage can also be read as the earliest recorded Chinese attempt                    to conceptualize <marquage typemarq="italique">fanyi</marquage> 翻譯                    (translation), even if there is no way of ascertaining how conscious that                    attempt had been. Viewed from this angle, the passage has enormous theoretical                    significance. It presents an interesting picture of four terms (<marquage typemarq="italique">ji </marquage>寄, <marquage typemarq="italique">xiang                    </marquage>象, <marquage typemarq="italique">Didi </marquage>狄鞮, <marquage typemarq="italique">yi</marquage> 譯), used simultaneously to denote the                    activity now called <marquage typemarq="italique">fanyi</marquage> 翻譯                    (translation). In the form of a mindmap, there is an empty space, with the four                    terms occupying the four cardinal positions, as if to circumscribe its boundary.                    The visual immediacy of this picture reminds us that there was no fixed                    designation for translation at the time when the activity first became important                    enough to be institutionalized as a government post and mentioned in historical                    documents. And it was most probably due to frequency of usage that <marquage typemarq="italique">yi</marquage> 譯 eventually came to stand for the                    activity now called <marquage typemarq="italique">fanyi</marquage> 翻譯, or                        <marquage typemarq="souligne">translation</marquage> in English. Rather than                    dismissing <marquage typemarq="italique">ji </marquage>寄, <marquage typemarq="italique">xiang</marquage> 象 and <marquage typemarq="italique">didi</marquage> 狄鞮 and their related annotations as false trails, I would                    argue that they are as instrumental as <marquage typemarq="italique">yi</marquage> 譯 in helping to illuminate what, in the days before Buddhist                    sutra translation became the dominant mode of translation activity in China,                    could be singled out as the distinct traits of translation as a concept.<renvoi id="re1no13" idref="no13" typeref="note">13</renvoi></alinea></para></section1><section1 id="s1n4"><no>4</no><titre>3.

Perhaps because                    Buddhist sutra translation is very different from the kind of diplomatic                    translation performed by government functionaries, the empty space that had been                    filled by the character <marquage typemarq="italique">yi</marquage> 譯 gradually                    came to be occupied by a number of other characters as well, and one can see                    another configuration.

But there are also                    instances of usage that suggest a broader meaning, as for example in<marquage typemarq="italique"> Chusanzang jiji</marquage> 出三藏記集 (<marquage typemarq="italique">A Collection of the Records on the Emanation of the                        Chinese Tripitaka</marquage>) – the title of the oldest extant bibliography                    of Buddhist texts collated by the fifth century Buddhist monk Seng You 僧祐                    (445-518). There, <marquage typemarq="italique">chu </marquage>出 retains its                    usual meaning (i.e., “bring forth,” “help something to come out,” “contribute to                    the emanation of,” or “make available”) and functions to acknowledge the effort                    of every person who had worked as part of a team to make the Buddhist sutras                    available for dissemination in China. This act of acknowledgement was considered                    necessary because Buddhist sutra translation was characterized by teamwork, with                    the participants ranging from a few in the early stages to several hundred at                    the height of the translation movement.<renvoi id="re1no14" idref="no14" typeref="note">14</renvoi></alinea></para><para id="pa25"><no>25</no><alinea>There is another character that was often used, not interchangeably with                        <marquage typemarq="italique">yi</marquage> 譯 (translation) but to elucidate                    the meaning of <marquage typemarq="italique">yi</marquage> 譯.

It is different, too, from the annotation of <marquage typemarq="italique">yi</marquage> 譯 (to translate) provided by Jia Gongyan,                    also cited earlier, “‘to translate’ means ‘to exchange,’ that is to say, to                    change and replace the words of one language by another to achieve mutual                    understanding” (Jia 1983: 620, translated by the author).</alinea></para><para id="pa27"><no>27</no><alinea>Interestingly and significantly, the annotation, “‘to translate’ means ‘to                    exchange’” (譯即易) has been given another explanation by the tenth century monk                    Zan Ning贊寧 (919-1001): “To translate [<marquage typemarq="italique">yì</marquage> 譯] means to exchange [<marquage typemarq="italique">yì</marquage> 易], that is to say, to exchange what one has for what one                    does not have.” (譯之言易也，謂以所有易所無也。) (Zan Ning 1993a: 3; Cheung 2006: 174,                    translated by Martha Cheung). Such an explanation has rich theoretical                    significance. The phrase, “To exchange what one has for what one does not have,”                    is a direct quotation from Mengzi 孟子 (327-289 BCE): “In antiquity, the market                    was for the exchange of what one had for what one did not have” (古之為市也，<marquage typemarq="souligne">以其所有易其所無</marquage>者，有司者治之耳) (Zhu 1987: 43; Cheung 2006:                    174, translated by Martha Cheung). In that passage, the sage Mengzi tells the                    story of how in ancient times, the state initially played a supervisory role in                    the markets, only introducing a tax on traders because of the despicable                    behaviour of a man overcome with greed. The story highlights a notion of trading                    motivated by the spirit of exchange in its most civilized sense, and that is,                    exchange which is based on need rather than greed, and which results in mutual                    enrichment, fulfilment and contentment. By quoting directly from Mengzi, Zan                    Ning invokes this spirit of exchange as the defining feature of translation. He                    is trying to move away from the linguistic dimension to the cultural dimension                    of <marquage typemarq="italique">yi</marquage> 譯 (translation). He is stressing                    the value of cultural exchange. </alinea></para><para id="pa28"><no>28</no><alinea>Equally significant theoretically is that the Chinese character <marquage typemarq="italique">yi</marquage> 易 does not simply mean “exchange” but also                    “change,” and Zan Ning clearly thinks that “change” is an integral part of the                    process of exchange. By a happy coincidence, the English word <marquage typemarq="italique">exchange</marquage> embodies the word <marquage typemarq="italique">change</marquage> and can easily convey this point. This                    point, moreover, is brought out in another piece of writing by Zan Ning, in                    which he talks about the meaning of <marquage typemarq="italique">fan</marquage>                    翻 – the remaining term in the configuration:</alinea><bloccitation><alinea>懿乎<marquage typemarq="souligne">東漢</marquage>，始譯《四十二章經》，復加之為翻也。翻也者，如翻錦綺，背面俱花，但其花有左右不同耳。由是翻譯二名行焉。</alinea><source>Zan Ning 1993b: 23-25</source></bloccitation><bloccitation><alinea><marquage typemarq="italique">[…] the Eastern Han Dynasty saw the first                            translation of the Sutra in Forty-two Chapters 四十二章經</marquage><marquage typemarq="italique">[Sishierzhang jing].

At the same time, this mega configuration can serve as the basis for a big                    comparative project on notions of translation in China and in other traditions.                    Researchers could investigate whether similar endeavours at conceptualization                    and reconceptualization have also characterized the history of discourse on                    translation in their tradition.

If no defining characteristics can be identified across different                    cultural traditions, we can still ask searching questions about the modes of                    practice, the purposes and functions of translation, and other contextual                    questions to examine what are the historical and local specificities that have                    given rise to the distinct features of individual concepts of translation from                    different cultural traditions.</alinea></para><para id="pa44"><no>44</no><alinea>This is a hugely ambitious project, but it is also hugely important.

This explanation is inspired by an expression used                    by Qian Zhongshu in “The Translations of Lin Shu”: <marquage typemarq="italique">xuhan shuyi</marquage> 虛涵數意 (1979). Qian used that expression to translate                    the term <marquage typemarq="souligne">manifold meaning</marquage> and to                    provide a hint for his readers to read his essay not as a legislation of the                    root meaning of <marquage typemarq="italique">fanyi</marquage> 翻譯 (translation)                    but as an innovative handling of some lexicographical material pertinent to                    translation. I would like to borrow Qian’s expression and use it for a different                    purpose – to help me in my endeavour to reconceptualize <marquage typemarq="italique">fanyi</marquage> 翻譯 (translation). But first I need to                    explain the character <marquage typemarq="italique">xu</marquage> 虛 in the                    expression <marquage typemarq="italique">xuhan shuyi</marquage> 虛涵數意 for it is a                    word which carries rich meanings in traditional Chinese thought. </alinea></para><para id="pa47"><no>47</no><alinea>As a key concept in Daoism, one of the most important schools of thought in                    China, <marquage typemarq="italique">xu</marquage> 虛 is usually explained and                    translated as “emptiness,” “void,” “vacant,” but other renderings are also                    possible because <marquage typemarq="italique">xu</marquage> 虛 is the                    philosophical underpinning of a lot of expressions used in ordinary everyday                    language. As listed in the dictionary <marquage typemarq="italique">Hanyu da                        cidian</marquage> (漢語大詞典) (1988), <marquage typemarq="italique">xu</marquage> 虛 can be used to describe principles, or theories, or ideas                    and it means “abstract.” In another context, as for example in the expression                        <marquage typemarq="italique">xuwu piaomiao</marquage> 虛無縹緲, which is often                    used in discussions about a phenomenon or a state, the character <marquage typemarq="italique">xu</marquage> 虛 would be rendered as “imaginary” or                    “illusory.” In describing interpersonal relationship, someone who relates to                    another person (usually an enemy) in a superficially friendly manner is                    described as <marquage typemarq="italique">xuyu weiyi</marquage> 虛與委蛇 (<marquage typemarq="souligne">pretending to be</marquage> amiable and agreeable),                    while a person who is modest and open-minded is often characterized as <marquage typemarq="italique">xuhuai ruogu</marquage> 虛懷若谷 (having a mind that is as                        <marquage typemarq="souligne">receptive</marquage> as a valley). In the                    context of traditional Chinese medicine, the term <marquage typemarq="italique"><marquage typemarq="souligne">xu</marquage></marquage> 虛 (frequently                    translated as “vacuity”) also features in descriptions of symptoms, and “refers                    to a general insufficiency of vitality, energy, and functioning of the body”                    (Zhang and Rose 1999: 225). </alinea></para><para id="pa48"><no>48</no><alinea><marquage typemarq="italique">Xu</marquage> 虛 (emptiness) as a conceptual                    term is often used together with its conceptual opposite <marquage typemarq="italique">shi</marquage> 實 (concrete, solid, full, substantial,                    actual, true, real, fact, replete, again a term with many translations). In                    Daoist thinking, emptiness (<marquage typemarq="italique">xu</marquage> 虛) and                    fullness (<marquage typemarq="italique">shi</marquage> 實) exist in a                    relationship of mutual generation, and this relationship is expressed as                        <marquage typemarq="italique">xushi xiangsheng</marquage> 虛實相生 (the empty                    and the full, or the abstract and the concrete, give rise to each other). This                    is the philosophical foundation upon which the expression used by Qian Zhongshu                    – <marquage typemarq="italique">xuhan shuyi</marquage> 虛涵數意 – is based. A word                    for word translation of this expression is “emptily-holding-several-meanings,”                    or “notionally-holding-several-meanings,” which is more idiomatic. I will use                    this expression, and the Daoist idea of mutual generation that lies behind it,                    in my reconceptualization of <marquage typemarq="italique">fanyi</marquage>                    (translation): 虛涵數意是翻譯 <marquage typemarq="italique">xuhan shuyi shi                        fanyi</marquage> (word-for-word translation,                    “notionally-holding-several-meanings-is-translation”). At the figurative level,                    the term <marquage typemarq="italique">fanyi</marquage> 翻譯 (translation), is                    like a container, it holds/contains/carries (the meaning of 涵 <marquage typemarq="italique">han</marquage>, the second character of the expression                        <marquage typemarq="italique">xu-han-shu-yi</marquage>) meanings, but the                    meanings can be emptied out and new semantic contents filled in. This happens                    because of the principle of mutual generation of <marquage typemarq="italique">xu</marquage> 虛 and <marquage typemarq="italique">shi</marquage> 實 – a                    container is <marquage typemarq="italique">xu</marquage> 虛 because it has space                    (implying emptiness) and hence can hold things (implied meaning of <marquage typemarq="italique">shi</marquage> 實); likewise, a container can be emptied,                    become <marquage typemarq="italique">xu</marquage>虛 again, and take in new                    things. What we have analyzed in the previous section, namely, the designations,                    meanings and definitions of the concept now called <marquage typemarq="italique">fanyi</marquage>翻譯 (translation), are the concrete (<marquage typemarq="italique">shi</marquage> 實) meanings injected in different                    historical contexts into the empty (<marquage typemarq="italique">xu</marquage>                    虛) space of the concept now called <marquage typemarq="italique">fanyi</marquage> 翻譯 (translation). They last for as long as they can as                    working definitions but can be displaced, replaced, or re-placed. When that                    happens, they become inoperable as meaning – become <marquage typemarq="italique">xu</marquage> 虛. The appearance and disappearance of                    these configurations of terms used to, as it were, hold the meaning(s) of the                    concept now called <marquage typemarq="italique">fanyi</marquage> 翻譯                    (translation) is a manifestation of the working of the principle of mutual                    generation of <marquage typemarq="italique">xu</marquage>虛 and <marquage typemarq="italique">shi</marquage> 實. The mega configuration (Table 1) I                    have produced in the previous section is an attempt to activate this principle                    by gathering the meanings that have been rendered null and void (<marquage typemarq="italique">xu</marquage> 虛) and make them operable (<marquage typemarq="italique">shi</marquage> 實) again for further intellectual                        exploration.<renvoi id="re1no17" idref="no17" typeref="note">17</renvoi></alinea></para><para id="pa49"><no>49</no><alinea>It should be noted that my reconceptualization, <marquage typemarq="italique">xuhan shuyi shi fanyi</marquage> 虛涵數意是翻譯                    “notionally-holding-several-meanings-is-translation,” is itself an abstract                        (<marquage typemarq="italique">xu</marquage>虛) statement because the term                        “<marquage typemarq="italique">fanyi</marquage>” 翻譯 can serve as both a verb                    and a noun, Chinese not being an inflectional language. The reconceptualization                    can be elucidated in accordance with the principle of mutual generation of                        <marquage typemarq="italique">xu</marquage> 虛 and <marquage typemarq="italique">shi</marquage> 實. Used as a verb, the expression                        “<marquage typemarq="italique">fanyi</marquage> 翻譯 is <marquage typemarq="italique">xuhan shuyi</marquage> 虛涵數意” can be concretized to mean,                    “to translate is to hold (several) meanings notionally (in a target text verbal                    or written).” Used as a noun, the expression can mean “a translation holds                    (several) meanings notionally.” Still as a noun, the expression can also mean                    “the concept designated by the term <marquage typemarq="italique">fanyi</marquage> 翻譯 holds (several) meanings notionally.’ To put it simply,                        <marquage typemarq="italique">fanyi</marquage> 翻譯 (translation/to translate)                    can be defined as follows – <marquage typemarq="italique">fanyi</marquage> 翻譯,                    translation (is an activity/a product/a concept that) holds (several) meanings                    notionally. The meanings are notional and not final because language, as a                    system of signs, carries only provisional meanings. Another reason is, every act                    of translation is carried out in the concrete circumstances of time and space by                    a particular person or a group of persons, and every work of translation or                    every definition of the concept now called translation is the product of an                    individual or a group effort made in time and in space. A change in contextual                    factors will set into operation the principle of mutual generation of <marquage typemarq="italique">xu</marquage> 虛 and <marquage typemarq="italique">shi</marquage> 實 and there will be the space or need for a new attempt at                    translating, for a new translation, or a new definition of the concept.                </alinea></para><para id="pa50"><no>50</no><alinea>Reconceptualizing translation, therefore, is a permanent intellectual                    endeavour, for practical reasons and also philosophical reasons.

Conclusion</titre><para id="pa51"><no>51</no><alinea>It can be said that the conceptualization of <marquage typemarq="italique">fanyi</marquage> 翻譯 (translation) just proposed comes close to the                    definition of translation provided by Maria Tymoczko. In her latest work                        <marquage typemarq="italique">Enlarging Translation, Empowering                        Translators</marquage> (2007), Tymoczko argues that translation is a cluster                    concept, in the sense in which Wittgenstein describes an open concept, and that                    is, a concept with no set demarcation of boundary, with the properties relating                    to each other through family resemblance rather than fulfilling any necessary                    and sufficient conditions for membership. Wittgenstein illustrates what he means                    by an open concept with the example of games. From him, Tymoczko borrows the                    idea and presents <marquage typemarq="italique">translation</marquage> as a                    cluster concept, in contra-distinction to the influential view that translation                    is a prototypical concept. What is more, she says that translation is a                    cross-cultural, cross-linguistic cluster concept. </alinea></para><para id="pa52"><no>52</no><alinea>The conceptualization of <marquage typemarq="italique">fanyi</marquage> 翻譯 I                    have proposed: <marquage typemarq="italique">fanyi</marquage>, translation (is                    an activity/a product/a concept that) holds (several) meanings notionally                    (虛涵數意是翻譯), can be taken as a Daoist version of the notion of translation as a                    cluster concept. The difference is, Tymoczko asserts that translation <marquage typemarq="souligne">is</marquage> a cluster concept, while my position is                    that <marquage typemarq="italique">fanyi</marquage> 翻譯 (translation) <marquage typemarq="souligne">can be defined</marquage> as “an activity/a product/a                    concept that holds (several) meanings notionally.” The former is an ontological                    statement – assertive, bold, ringing with authority, flamboyant in its readiness                    to embrace closure, a closure that paradoxically can continue to take in new                    definitions. The latter is a counter-narrative – episodic, self-conscious about                    the provisionality of its status as definition, exuding not authority but the                    almost stubborn energy of the -ing.</alinea></para><para id="pa53"><no>53</no><alinea>But, as the Chinese saying goes, <marquage typemarq="italique">shutu                        tonggui</marquage> 殊途同歸 – we reach the same goal via different routes, and                    that goal is, to introduce a new mindset for thinking and discoursing about                        <marquage typemarq="italique">fanyi</marquage> 翻譯/translation. In this era                    of globalization, when communication technology is developing by leaps and                    bounds, when ideas move round the globe at breakneck speed, when translation                    assumes a myriad of forms and there are bound to be new attempts to theorize the                    new realities of such practices, it looks likely that the energy of the -ing                    will remain active for a long time to come.

It means                    “explaining” (<marquage typemarq="italique">shuō </marquage>說 [talk about;                    discuss; elucidate; explain]) the<marquage typemarq="italique"> wén</marquage> 文                    and “analyzing” (<marquage typemarq="italique">jiě </marquage>解 [untie; cut                    apart; separate; analyze;]) the<marquage typemarq="italique"> zì</marquage> 字.                    In Xu’s explanation, <marquage typemarq="italique">wén</marquage> 文 and                        <marquage typemarq="italique">zì</marquage> 字 represent two main types of                    Chinese characters, the former being those made up of a single graphic component                    of stroke-pattern (such as <marquage typemarq="italique">shān</marquage> 山                    [mountain], or the character <marquage typemarq="italique">wén</marquage> 文                    itself), and the latter being those made up of more than one such component                    (such as <marquage typemarq="italique">míng</marquage> 鳴 [sing], with <marquage typemarq="italique">kŏu</marquage> 口 [mouth] on the left side and niăo 鳥                    [bird] on the right, or the character <marquage typemarq="italique">zì                    </marquage>字, which is composed of <marquage typemarq="italique">mián</marquage>                    宀 at the upper part and <marquage typemarq="italique">zĭ</marquage> 子 below).                    The first type of characters (<marquage typemarq="italique">wén</marquage> 文)                    are not reducible to smaller units for analysis, and hence they can only be                    “talked about” , “discussed,” “elucidated” or “explained.” The second type                        (<marquage typemarq="italique">zì</marquage> 字), on the other hand, can be                    analyzed in terms of their component parts. These two categories, <marquage typemarq="italique">wén</marquage> 文 and <marquage typemarq="italique">zì</marquage> 字, however, are not to be confused with the six categories                    called <marquage typemarq="italique">liùshū</marquage> 六書 (six [forms of]                    scripts) into which all Chinese characters are classified. The <marquage typemarq="italique">liùshū</marquage> 六書 also represent the six principles                    by which Chinese characters are formed. The elucidation of meaning carried out                    by Xu in <marquage typemarq="italique">Shuowen</marquage> is based on his                    understanding of <marquage typemarq="italique">liùshū</marquage> 六書, and                    specifically of the principles of pictographic imitation, combination,                    substitution, borrowing and association underlying the formation of Chinese                    characters. For a lucid explanation, in English, of these principles, see                    Needham (1954: 27-41). For a good introduction to the Chinese writing system,                    see Boltz (1994; revised 2003).</alinea></note><note id="no5"><no>5</no><alinea>Before Buddhist sutra translation, the Chinese character <marquage typemarq="italique">yi</marquage> 譯 was used singly to mean ‘translate’/                    ‘translation.’ Even now, when the term <marquage typemarq="italique">fanyi</marquage> 翻譯 is generally used to mean ‘translate’/‘translation,’                        <marquage typemarq="italique">yi</marquage> 譯 still serves the same                    function, with the meaning unchanged. </alinea></note><note id="no6"><no>6</no><alinea>In the lucid explanation of Boltz (2003: 181), phonophoric is “that                    component of a Chinese character that ‘bears the sound,’ i.e., that indicates or                    suggests the pronunciation; commonly, but imprecisely, called a ‘phonetic.’” In                    the Chinese writing system, the meanings of a character are to be analyzed and                    gleaned not only from its semantic component (determinative or radical) but also                    from its sound-bearing component. However, due to phonological changes, there                    are often discrepancies between the pronunciation of a character in ancient                    times and its pronunciation at a later period. In such cases, Xu would retain                    the phonophoric of the entry item so that the meanings of that entry item can be                    traced. At the same time, he would indicate how that entry item is to be                    pronounced by adding the phrase “pronounced – ” (讀若 –). The entry (<marquage typemarq="italique">e</marquage> 囮) discussed by Qian Zhongshu is an                    illustrative example. 化, now pronounced ‘<marquage typemarq="italique">huà</marquage>’ is the phonophoric, and the entry character 囮 is                    “pronounced ‘<marquage typemarq="italique">é</marquage>’ (讀若譌).”</alinea></note><note id="no7"><no>7</no><alinea>The Chinese in ancient times had always been wary of their neighbours.
