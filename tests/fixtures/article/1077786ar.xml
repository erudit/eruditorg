        <alinea>According to the U.S. Forum for Sustainable and Responsible Investment (US SIF),
          socially responsible assets reached $12 billion in the United States in 2018, an increase
          of 38% in comparison to 2016<renvoi id="re1no1" idref="no1" typeref="note">1</renvoi>. Most of this growth is
          related to asset managers’ interest in environmental, social and governance (ESG)
          criteria. This is due to the desire to meet the new ethical requirements of their
          customers, but also extends beyond that. Indeed, the incorporation of corporate social
          responsibility (CSR) criteria into asset management is not a new idea. It is justified
          financially by the need to diversify the available information and to limit information
          asymmetries (Bouslah <marquage typemarq="italique">et al., </marquage>2013). The objective
          is to limit sharp losses in value (Godfrey <marquage typemarq="italique">et al.,</marquage> 2009) and focus investments on good assets that have not yet been
          evaluated by the market (Edmans, 2011). Moreover, socially responsible portfolios seem to
          perform better than traditional funds (Shalchian <marquage typemarq="italique">et al.,</marquage> 2018).</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa2"><no>2</no>
        <alinea>Responsible information is a major issue for asset management. This objective is met
          by the development of sustainability reports, such as the Global Reporting Initiative
          (GRI) report, which proposes a homogeneity of reporting practices for corporate
          responsibility policies. This report summarizes the company’s economic, social and
          environmental information, grouping it by the notion of overall performance. However, this
          homogenization does not render the discourse meaningless. In fact, the actors will,
          through language, try to make objective their very subjective view of corporate social
          responsibility (Berger and Luckmann, 1966). These reports are therefore not aimed at
          objectivity. They are the result of choice in the treatment of CSR dimensions. Thus, GRI
          reports are subject to the inherent problems of speeches. Its purpose is to influence the
          company’s image. The firm strives to legitimize its actions by creating meaning, so that
          its activities are considered in referenced frameworks. Discourse is never objective, even
          if it allows the exchange of information. It aims to transform the perception of the
          receiver, to modify his belief system and his behavioral attitude. Sustainability reports
          are not similar to “<marquage typemarq="italique">household stories</marquage>” nor
          “<marquage typemarq="italique">engagement stories,</marquage>” but rather to a story of
          legitimization (D’Almeida, 2006, p. 27). The company justifies its actions with discourses
          addressed to the appropriate stakeholders (Preston and Post, 1981), which is similar to a
          “<marquage typemarq="italique">license to operate</marquage>” (Igalens, 2007, p. 131). The
          analysis of sustainability reports is then defined as a measure of social discourse rather
          than a measure of social performance (Ullmann, 1985).</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa3"><no>3</no>
        <alinea>There is also a paradox in the sustainability reports in regard to the notion of
          overall performance. This notion is often put forward but rarely verified. As a result,
          even though responsible communications target all stakeholders, they are mainly directed
          towards shareholders and financial actors who are likely to use ESG information
          (Arvidsson, 2010). Overall performance does not induce an intrinsic link between social
          performance and financial performance. The effects of CSR on the financial performance
          strongly depends on managers’ intentions. The latter is likely to develop greenwashing and
          entrenchment strategies, which must be detected in the discourse.</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa4"><no>4</no>
        <alinea>Discourse analysis in sustainability reports can enable asset managers to obtain
          information that can affect the performance of their portfolio. In fact, the “negative
          screening” approach is still prevalent in socially responsible mutual funds (Kotsantonis
          <marquage typemarq="italique">et al.,</marquage> 2016), and the second common sustainable
          strategy involves a combination of ESG integration. However, “negative screening”
          strategies lead to a limitation of the universe of asset investments. Consequently, if we
          follow the financial theory, the financial performance of the portfolio will be lower.
          Today’s investment strategies seem to be evolving -- <marquage typemarq="italique">“Investors seem to be looking at a more balanced approach in which firms meet an SR
          criteria based on their overall profile rather than a simple exclusionary policy”
          </marquage>(Berry and Junkus, 2013, p. 718).</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa5"><no>5</no>
        <alinea>The aim of this study is to allow investors to identify, in the sustainability
          reports, lexical fields that reveal the company’s intentions and real involvement. Indeed,
          <marquage typemarq="italique">“Only a relatively small subset of the ESG data is what
          might be described as material and hence value-relevant for each industry”</marquage>
          (Kotsantonis <marquage typemarq="italique">et al.,</marquage> 2016, p. 11). It is then
          necessary to take an interest in the responsible discourse of the company in order to
          understand the firm’s motivations for implementing a CSR approach. This research aims to
          be integrated into positive screening and in active analysis of ownership, which will
          become increasingly important in the future (Amel-Zadeh and Zarafaim, 2018, p. 15). It
          takes into consideration that, <marquage typemarq="italique">“Full integration and
          engagement are considered more beneficial and are driven by relevance to investment
          performance”</marquage> (Amel-Zadeh and Zarafaim, 2018, p. 1). In order to highlight the
          existing subjectivities in the responsible discourse, we suggest combining the lexical
          analysis with an objective measurement of the corporate social responsibility and
          financial performance of the firm. To our knowledge, there are no articles that have
          compared the lexical fields of the company sustainability reports with the level of
          sustainability and the financial performance of the firm. Our results confirm the interest
          of considering these discourses in order to better guide asset choices.</alinea>

        <alinea>CSR is a legitimized construction, supported through communication (Chaudri, 2016,
          p. 423). It remains a strong link between communication and action in all organizational
          processes because saying is doing and because actions speak (Christensen <marquage typemarq="italique">et al.,</marquage> 2011, p. 460; Schoeneborn and Trittin, 2013).
          According to Forman and Argenti (2005), there remains a strong connection between the
          communications of a company and the implementation of its strategy. As a result, the way
          in which a company speaks about itself and its communications practices is not neutral and
          is an activity that contributes to the adoption of organizational reality (Christensen
          <marquage typemarq="italique">et al.,</marquage> 2011, p. 461). The organization’s
          rhetoric is intended to influence the actors in order to create support for the firm’s
          practices while undermining opposition to them (Conrad and Poole, 2005, p. 410).</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa7"><no>7</no>
        <alinea>Communication on corporate social responsibility is made up of three predominant
          perspectives: the instrumental approach, the relational approach, and the constructivist
          approach (Chaudri, 2016). Each of the approaches is present in the sustainability reports.
          Beyond the return on investment, companies mainly seek to keep their legitimacy (Capron
          and Quairel, 2004). Elements of structuring and language have already been highlighted in
          previous research. Most of them share the principles of legitimacy theory (Lindblom, 1994;
          Deegan, 2002). They argue that organizations seek to be perceived as acting in accordance
          with the norms of the society in which they operate. Igalens (2007) put forward the
          organization’s search for credibility. Sustainability reports are not advertising, but the
          same rules apply to sustainability advertising and reporting.</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa8"><no>8</no>
        <alinea>The paradox set by the notion of global performance has a significant impact on the
          subjectivity and information that flows from sustainability reports. There is, for
          example, a strong use of doublespeak, where the speaker rarely offers a review of the
          past. Attarça and Jacquot (2005), through an analysis of the managers’ speeches at 85
          French, German and English companies, reveal that the language of CSR strives to give a
          positive image of the company. There is a tendency to conceal the constraints and
          difficulties, most often conveying the illusion of commitment. The concealment of negative
          elements is a preponderant feature of sustainability reporting. Cho <marquage typemarq="italique">et al.,</marquage> (2010) found that companies with the lowest
          environmental performance highlight positive information while hiding that which could be
          seen as negative. These companies are trying to benefit from stakeholders’
          impressions.</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa9"><no>9</no>
        <alinea>The sustainability report matches with a selective valuation of certain dimensions
          of corporate social responsibility. The paradox that exists between the notion of
          corporate social responsibility and business objectives leads to the occultation of
          problematic dimensions. Only themes that enhance the company’s value are present.
          Communication is most often symbolic or substantial. This often makes corporate social
          behavior disconnected from the company’s strategy (Attarça and Jacquot, 2005). Corporate
          social responsibility is most often approached as a juxtaposed and non-integrated issue.
          As a result, companies’ CSR commitments are made relative to their economic opportunities.
          The different strategies for disclosing non-financial information serves a variety of
          purposes which guide the discourse in sustainability reports. Thus, we make the hypothesis
          that CSR discourse can reveal the real corporate strategies.</alinea>
        <alinea><marquage typemarq="italique"><marquage typemarq="gras">H1: According to the CSR
          level and financial performance, the lexical field is dissimilar within the discourse of
          sustainability reports.</marquage></marquage></alinea>

				2</no><titre>The Hidden Strategies</titre><para id="pa10"><no>10</no>
        <alinea>We also assume that the purpose of the CSR discourse is to conceal breaches of
          corporate responsibility. The company will seek to embellish the situation, highlighting
          some activities while concealing the most negative points. Speeches can disguise
          entrenchment strategies from executive managers. In this case, it would be costly for an
          investor to contribute to these companies on the basis of ESG criteria. This hypothesis is
          based on the agency theory concept of Jensen and Meckling (1976), in which managers tend
          to take private benefits at shareholder expense (Jiao, 2010). CSR would then be the
          expression of managerial opportunism (Kim <marquage typemarq="italique">et al.,</marquage>
          2012), and would constitute a significant cost in resource diversification for the firm
          (Cordeiro and Sarkis, 1997). Thus, there is an over-investment in CSR activities by
          managers whose goal is to build a reputation as a “good citizen” among stakeholders
          (Barnea and Rubin, 2010; Harjoto and Jo, 2011). CSR is then considered as an opportunistic
          and costly measurement for the company and its shareholders. According to Friedman (1970),
          it is seen as an agency problem, a hypocrisy that seeks to develop an image, equivalent to
          fraud among stakeholders. It is not surprising that some authors theoretically support the
          existence of a negative relationship between corporate social performance and financial
          performance. Improving a firm’s responsibility increases the company’s costs and leads to
          a decrease in its competitive advantages (Odgen and Watson, 1999; Lu <marquage typemarq="italique">et al.,</marquage> 2013).</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa11"><no>11</no>
        <alinea>The discourse is supposed to be consistent with the firm’s level of responsibility
          and performance. Indeed, CSR approaches are a set of choices that reflect the company’s
          values (Chin <marquage typemarq="italique">et al.,</marquage> 2013). It is therefore
          likely that the themes of responsible discourse can inform us about the firm’s overall
          performance. This link is not direct, but in the context of the variety of CSR objectives,
          it is likely that the responsible discourse will reveal the real motivations of managers.
          In addition, the impact of CSR on financial performance seems to be particularly related
          to the types of responsible investments made. Following the stakeholder theory, and more
          particularly the distinction made by Agle <marquage typemarq="italique">et al.,</marquage>
          (2008) between primary and secondary stakeholders, we can, through discourse, reveal the
          differences in purpose. Indeed, the primary stakeholders are in a contractual relationship
          with the company, which makes them essential to economic activity. Secondary stakeholders
          do not have contractual relationships and are therefore not critical to the development of
          the company’s activities and profitability. As a result, responsibility is most often
          approached as a problem alongside and not part of the objective of profit
          maximization.</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa12"><no>12</no>
        <alinea>Thus, the discourse used in responsibility reports can be linked to the strategies
          chosen by management. The choices made in the discourse reflect the strategic choices and,
          consequently, the speech objectives correspond to a level of responsibility and financial
          performance. Only a few speeches are thus in line with maximizing investors’ interests. We
          believe that this discourse should reveal the company’s deep strategy through the presence
          or absence of certain lexical fields.</alinea>

        <alinea>Our lexical analysis focuses on 53 sustainability reports and 125 opening statements
          of CEOs from S&amp;P 500 companies in 2012. The responsibility reports reviewed refer to
          the year 2012, however, the calculation of the level of responsible and financial
          performance is calculated over a five-year period between 2008 and 2012. The objective is
          to smooth out performance measures, knowing that the discourse is built over the years and
          is established as a reflection of past performance. The period studied follows the
          subprime mortgage crisis. This crisis has greatly highlighted the excesses of the
          financial sector and reminded us of the importance of responsibility criteria in
          investment strategies. During this period, interest in responsible information has
          increased significantly, through the considerable development of responsible rating
          agencies. This enthusiasm has not dried up since then. Thus, this period of economic
          slowdown is likely to encourage interest in responsibility and thus allow us to see a
          strong link between the discourse and the firm’s overall performance. This link has since
          increased, particularly with the recent consideration of the United Nation’s sustainable
          development objectives. In addition, we assume that the results obtained will remain
          relevant for the following years. Indeed, according to Kotsantonis <marquage typemarq="italique">et al.,</marquage> (2016), <marquage typemarq="italique">“Since the
          mid-1990s, the positive correlation patterns in primary studies have been stable over
          time”</marquage> (p. 226).</alinea>

        <alinea>The GRI reports have been retrieved from the Bloomberg data platform and refer to
          the GRI 3.1 standard in effect in 2012. In order to conduct our research, we used the
          semantic analysis software “Alceste.” It allows the extraction of classes of meaning made
          up of words and sentences. The software is a word dictionary while also defining the root
          and frequency of the words used. The terms we will find in the classes correspond to the
          root of several words. For example, <marquage typemarq="italique">measure (9), measured
          (3), measurement (1), measurements (1) and measures (3)</marquage> will give the root
          <marquage typemarq="italique">measure</marquage>. It will then be counted as present
          17 times.</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa15"><no>15</no>
        <alinea>The software subdivides the corpus into homogeneous texts containing a sufficient
          number of words. This results in a classification of the segments according to the
          strongest opposition. Thus, the extracted classes give us a basis for the analysis of the
          corpus. According to Seignour (2011), semantic software makes it possible to reveal
          variations that are not visible on reading and is a valuable help for analysis. No
          interpretation is performed by this type of software. It is up to the researcher to
          decipher each class. To do this, the words are sorted by Chi2 levels and an examination of
          the terms with the highest level of Chi2 allows us to interpret the classes defined by the
          analysis.</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa16"><no>16</no>
        <alinea>The main interest of this software is to give characteristics to the corpora. It is
          a “star line” in which we have defined the level of CSR, the level of financial
          performance, the name and the sector of the firm. These characteristics allow us to define
          the profiles relating to each class of speech. This methodology is innovative in financial
          research. In fact, we combine lexical analysis with data relating to the level of CSR and
          financial performance. Through this approach we manage to make the link with traditional
          financial theories. It also helps us to create a better analysis through the presence and
          absence of lexical classes. Thus, the use of Alceste software makes it possible to
          identify the topics covered in an objective manner (Platet-Pierrot and Giodano-Spring,
          2011).</alinea>

        <alinea>This financial performance measurement is interesting because it allows investors to
          measure the return of an investment compared to its risk. The profitability is compared
          here to the level of the risk-free rate and the volatility of the asset. In the context of
          CSR information disclosure, we suggest that the vocabulary used in sustainability reports
          intend to improve the financial performance of the company by an increase of its appraisal
          on the market.</alinea>

        <alinea>Our lexical analysis exploits more than 90% of the Initial Context Unit (ICU). This
          percentage is very significant as a value higher than 60% is a reasonable result for an
          analysis. The analysis of the discourses present in the sustainability reports refers us
          to the use of five distinct word classes, which we group into three major topics. The
          classes are named according to the highest levels of Chi2. Each class is also
          distinguished by a heterogeneous CSR and financial performance. Each major topic targets
          particular stakeholders and specific dimensions of sustainability. The characteristics
          related to the text provide us with information on the overall level of performance of
          firms. These characteristics allow us to answer the hypotheses established beforehand. The
          analysis of the full report relates three major topics, the first one corresponding to an
          ethical and governance approach which we have named <marquage typemarq="italique">“conventional discourse.”</marquage> The second is a human and community resources
          approach we have called the “<marquage typemarq="italique">compensatory
          discourse.</marquage>” Finally, there is also a discourse related to production and sales
          processes, which we have named “technical discourse.” </alinea>

        <alinea>Text Class 1, related to ethics and governance, includes the roots of words such as
          <marquage typemarq="italique">“police, law, govern, ethical, safe etc.”</marquage> Here,
          the company mainly understands CSR as complying with the law and as the implementation of
          a governance policy. The preponderance of this discourse in sustainability reports is
          characteristic of financially successful firms, through the presence of the <marquage typemarq="italique">“fie_perf_high”</marquage> characteristic (Chi2 = 12). The link
          between this type of discourse and good financial performance is consistent with financial
          theory, since good governance limits agency costs and compliance with ethical rules
          reduces the risk of fines for non-compliance with standards.</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa25"><no>25</no>
        <alinea>Nevertheless, a discourse on this topic remains rather conventional and does not
          seem proactive in terms of responsibility. It is therefore not surprising that this class
          of discourse is symptomatic of firms with little responsibility, particularly because of a
          high level of weakness with the presence of the characteristics CSR_low (Chi2 = 6) and
          weakness_high (Chi2 = 5). The occurrence of these discourse characteristics shows that
          these companies have not extended their notion of responsibility to simple governance
          criteria. Companies are therefore neglecting the other dimensions of CSR. The prevalence
          of a discourse based on ethics and governance does not show that firms are globally
          efficient, both in terms of financial and responsible performance. However, while this
          discourse is a good starting point for the management of the company, it will have to be
          complemented by an additional sustainability approach to be taken into account by
          responsible investors.</alinea>

        <alinea>The compensatory topic includes two classes of discussion, the Class 2
          “Community” and Class 3 “Employees and Skills.” The first one relates to philanthropy and
          includes the roots of words such as <marquage typemarq="italique">“community, grant,
          donate, disaster, children, etc. “</marquage> The second relates to the diversity and
          protection of employees, and includes references to <marquage typemarq="italique">“care,
          women, skill, people, workforce, etc.”</marquage> These two classes of discourse focus on
          a relational approach, either with secondary stakeholders, through communities, or with
          primary stakeholders, such as employees. However, these two lexical fields are
          characteristic of firms that are not very responsible and financially inefficient. The
          predominance of this type of discourse in sustainability reports will therefore not be a
          preferred choice for an investor.</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa27"><no>27</no>
        <alinea>Firstly, the philanthropic discourse is characterized by an average but never high
          financial performance. The analysis concludes that there is no strong financial
          performance feature revealed by an absence of the characteristic “<marquage typemarq="italique">fie_perf_high</marquage>” (Chi2 = -48). Philanthropic expenses are
          often decorrelated to the firm’s activities due to possible entrenchment strategies from
          managers, the latter seeking the rallying of the stakeholders to his cause in order to
          keep his place in the organization. The positive opinion of the stakeholders towards it is
          likely to influence shareholders. In fact, philanthropy refers to secondary stakeholders
          and is not expected to have a positive impact on financial performance<marquage typemarq="gras">. </marquage>Because philanthropy is seen as a waste of corporate
          resources, it is likely to be seen as an entrenchment strategy. Moreover, the level of CSR
          is not higher, the level of responsibility remains average and this discourse is not
          indicative of a high level of responsibility, due to the absence of the “<marquage typemarq="italique">CSR_high</marquage>” variables (Chi2 = -68) and “<marquage typemarq="italique">Strength_high</marquage>” (Chi2 = -37). The predominance of this
          discourse in sustainability reports raises the question of entrenchment strategy from the
          leaders. The very average level of the responsibility score corresponds more to
          greenwashing than to a real internal involvement of managers. At least there is no
          willingness to improve financial performance through CSR tools.</alinea>

        <alinea>Secondly, the consideration of human capital in the company discourse suggests the
          existence of possible weaknesses and poor financial performance. Indeed, our analysis
          reveals that firms that talk mainly about their employees are characterized by strong
          weaknesses (Chi2 = 24), a low level of CSR (Chi2 = 22) and a relatively poor financial
          performance. The missing characteristics confirm these results by the notable absence of
          <marquage typemarq="italique">“weakness_low”</marquage> and <marquage typemarq="italique">“fie_perf_high.”</marquage> Employees are one of the primary stakeholders, and their
          consideration should have a positive impact on financial performance (Edmans, 2011;
          Huselid, 1995). But the choice of discourse is not intrinsically linked to reality,
          particularly with regard to the consideration of employees. The choice of discourse used
          remains subjective and it seems that the preponderance of a discourse about employees
          reveals companies that are not very responsible and possibly not financially efficient
          with Chi2 levels for financial performance being low. The prevalence of such a discourse
          therefore does not follow the facts, which also suggests a possible greenwashing strategy
          on the part of leaders.</alinea>

        <alinea>It is therefore highly possible that companies that are not very responsible will
          promote this dimension of CSR without really being responsible. The strong presence in the
          sustainable reports for this discourse does not allow us to identify implicit strategies.
          This will require an analysis of the CEO’s speech.</alinea>

        <alinea>Our analysis reveals a third type of discourse relating to the production process.
          The lexical Class 4, called “Reduction of Material Consumption,” and Class 5, named “Waste
          Reduction and Reuse,” focus on developing technical terms. However, these two classes are
          strongly distinguished by their aim, with Class 4 being limited to the simple reduction of
          negative externalities while Class 5 emphasizes a proactive and integrated vision of
          CSR.</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa32"><no>32</no>
        <alinea>Firstly, Class 4 -- “Reduction of Material Consumption” -- aims to limit negative
          externalities related to pollution and features the keywords, <marquage typemarq="italique">“energy, emissions, gas, reduce, consumption, cost.”</marquage> This
          class is indicative of companies that have limited their negative externalities through
          low weakness (Chi2 = 9). For some, these firms even seem proactive through the presence of
          muscular strength-related characteristics. However, this concerns companies that may or
          may not be globally responsible. The absence of “<marquage typemarq="italique">CSR_medium</marquage>” reveals that firms using this discourse can be using two
          strategies, either reducing weaknesses, or in a proactive logic that improves the overall
          level of CSR by involving real strengths. Finally, it seems that this discourse is mainly
          present in firms that are under-performing financially. It may then be that the choice of
          CSR strategy is constrained by the sector or the company’s history. CSR would not be
          chosen but indirectly imposed.</alinea>

        <alinea>However, an investor seeking CSR performance should not focus his choices on this
          apparent technicality of the discourse. Indeed, CSR does not always seem to be implemented
          in all the company’s processes. As a result, it would be more interesting to invest in
          another technical discourse whose perspective is more proactive. Lexical Class 5 -- “Waste
          Reduction and Reuse” -- is focused on the reuse of waste within the production process. It
          contains key word roots such as <marquage typemarq="italique">“recycle, waste, material,
          reuse, minimize, etc.”</marquage> This lexical field is characterized by firms with high
          levels of CSR, many strengths and a notable absence of weaknesses. These companies have
          strongly integrated the responsibility process into their strategy and production process.
          The integration of CSR concerns into the company’s activities reflects a really high
          financial performance. The significant lack of “<marquage typemarq="italique">CSR_medium</marquage>” (Chi2 = -55) and “<marquage typemarq="italique">fie_perf_low</marquage>” (Chi2 = -10) characteristics confirms the interest for an

        <alinea>The semantic analysis of all sustainability reports reveals heterogeneous lexical
          fields depending on the level of CSR and financial performance. The various communications
          refer to the consideration of the legitimization strategies of Hahn and Lülfs (2014). The
          need for the company to legitimize its actions by the use of lexical terms which refer to
          governance, ethics, philanthropy and human resources is most often linked to a poor CSR
          performance. It is also necessary to avoid entrenchment strategies, often detectable by an
          abundance of philanthropic and human resources themes. The standardized discourse of the
          GRI does not appear to be totally homogeneous in 2012. Through the discourse used,
          companies indirectly provide information on the integration of their corporate social
          responsibility into the organization. The asset manager can then look for dissonances in
          the speeches in order to select the most responsible and financially efficient assets.
          However, it may also be interesting to analyze the CEO’s discourse in order to better
          identify the strategy behind responsible investment.</alinea>

        <alinea>In order to complete our analysis, we suggest a dissociated examination of the
          opening speech of the CEO in the GRI reports. Indeed, Conaway and Wardrope (2010) have
          discovered that CEOs communicate information about the company culture and become
          particular cultural rhetoricians. The CEO’s opening speech to the GRI is free and
          succinct, which forces him to make choices in the construction of his communication.
          Platet-Pierrot and Giordano-Spring (2011) have already been able to analyse the executive
          discourse. We have performed a similar analysis on 125 opening speeches from S&amp;P 500
          firms in 2012. Nevertheless, unlike the article by Platet-Pierrot and Giordano-Spring
          (2011), we added features that reflect the level of CSR and financial performance. Our
          results follow and complete our precedent conclusion. We reveal the presence of three
          distinct lexical classes, characterized by heterogeneous responsible and financial
          performances. These are summarized in Table 8 below.</alinea>

        <alinea>The technical discourse, transcribed in Class 1, is called “Releases and
          Consumption.” It echoes the limitation of polluting emissions through keywords such as
          <marquage typemarq="italique">“emission, energy, reduce, waste, greenhouse, reduction,
          etc.”</marquage> CEOs using this type of discourse lead low-responsibility firms, the
          strength score is generally low and the overall level of responsibility is also low.
          Moreover the financial performance of these firms seems to be low. These companies do not
          seem proactive in terms of CSR and the use of this lexical field fills the gaps of
          incomplete CSR across all dimensions. We assume that these firms only seek to limit
          negative externalities. These reductions granted by the firm do not seem sufficient to
          make it a socially responsible company. This technical approach is materialized by the

        <alinea>This technical approach in the CEOs’ discourse hides a low overall CSR. There is
          only a limitation of pre-existing negative externalities to the activity, whereas
          responsibility is defined above all as a proactive attitude. Firms whose CEOs use this
          lexical field for the most part should not be retained by investors concerned about the
          level of CSR. This speech is not a guarantee of an increased corporate social
          responsibility because it lacks a strong strategic consideration. The responsibility
          report then becomes a style effect aimed to improve the brand image.</alinea>

        <alinea>The analysis of the CEO’s speech also reveals a recurrence of the lexical field
          related to philanthropic acts. This speech refers to Class 2, called “Report to the
          Community.” It contains terms related to education - <marquage typemarq="italique">“educate, student, school, etc.”</marquage> and <marquage typemarq="italique">“nonprofit,
          grant, charity, contribute, veteran, etc.”</marquage> The promotion of charitable actions
          is part of an approach to improve the level of CSR and they are similar to strengths. This
          is confirmed by the presence of companies with a high level of strength (Chi2 = 9) and an
          equally high level of overall CSR. However, these firms are characterized by poor
          financial performance (Chi2 = 7), unlike the strategic discourse which presents firms that
          perform better financially for an equivalent level of corporate social
          responsibility.</alinea>

        <alinea>The emphasis on philanthropic acts in the opening speech of leaders reveals a
          strategy of entrenchment. We assume that the low financial performance of the company
          encourages executives to put in place actions that can help them safeguard their position
          on the assumption that the expenses directed towards the community will be a good way to
          keep their jobs. They allow employees to become involved through philanthropic projets so
          the firm and its manager will be valued and benefit from a positive image in the media.
          This strategy can then compensate for the poor results. Highlighting philanthropic
          activities may reveal entrenchment strategy, especially since these activities are not
          related to stakeholders who suffer from the firm’s negative externalities.</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa41"><no>41</no>
        <alinea>We also note that firms in the financial sector are highly represented in this
          class. Soana’s (2011) work advocated the development of community activities to improve
          overall performance in this industry. Nevertheless, the predominance of this type of
          discourse in the executive director’s message does not necessarily seem to lead to a
          strong financial performance, unlike the third class of “Long-Term Performance” speech.
          Indeed, the latter is strongly present in this area as well. In this sector, it is
          therefore preferable to invest in firms with a dominant strategic discourse. At an equal
          level of responsibility, the latter shows an increased financial performance.</alinea>

        <alinea>This speech relates a CSR policy integrated into the company’s long-term strategy.
          It corresponds to text unit Class 3, “Long-Term Performance.” The executives of these
          firms adopt a vocabulary related to the long-term performance of the company - “<marquage typemarq="italique">business, sustain, shareholder, value, etc</marquage>.” This approach
          focuses on value and shareholders. This lexical field is characterized by high-CSR firms
          with a high level of strength. These characteristics are confirmed by the visible absence
          of low CSR. In addition, this speech concerns companies whose financial performance in
          recent years has been relatively strong, compared to the sample selected.</alinea>

        <alinea>The analysis of the CEO’s introduction speech reveals that it would be preferable
          for an investor to select firms whose introduction speech is oriented towards the
          long-term performance of the firm. CSR must be to the benefit of the company through a
          better integration of its processes and actions within civil society. Our results suggest
          that any lexical addition related to pollution control or philanthropy does not indicate
          greater responsibility or increased financial performance -- on the contrary.</alinea>

        <alinea>We have shown that sustainable reporting is a valuable source of information. The
          analysis of these reports makes it possible to complete the informational need,
          particularly on the managerial approach, for new positive screening strategies in
          responsible asset selection, which will become increasingly important in the future. The
          objective is to define the optimal trade-off between social responsibility and other
          investment criteria (Berry, and Junkus, 2013, p. 708). Our analysis shows innovative
          results due to the contribution of objective criteria in our discourse analysis. We have
          revealed that the discourse in the sustainability reports and in the opening speech made
          by the CEO is different according to the level of financial performance and the level of
          CSR. These results confirm our first hypothesis, H1, that the analysis of the discourse in
          the sustainability reports with regard to the firm’s overall performance level contains
          information that is of substantial interest to investors. In addition, we were able to
          partially respond positively to our second hypothesis, H2, that the emphasis on some
          dimensions of CSR in the discourse seems not to be in line with the objectives of
          maximizing shareholder value. The additional analysis of CEO discourse helps us to improve
          our results and seems essential to the understanding of the managers’ CSR
          strategy.</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa45"><no>45</no>
        <alinea>Our results suggest that it is better to invest in firms that integrate their
          corporate social responsibility discourse into their production processes and within their
          long-term financial strategy. The presence of other speeches will be less consistent with
          the search for overall performance. Philanthropic discourses most often seek to compensate
          for high levels of weakness or possible entrenchment strategy. Speeches relating to
          technicality, where the reader is fed with quantitative data, are also not a guarantee of
          a high CSR level. Finally, the use of lexical fields close to the notions of respect for
          law and governance suggests a company that will be financially efficient but does not have
          a proactive stance in its CSR approach. These companies can be considered as followers and
          do not invest in material CSR engagement. These results are consistent with Odell and Ali
          (2016), <marquage typemarq="italique">“That CSR often manifests itself in charitable
          efforts that are relatively independent of the core business, such as building health
          clinics or supporting schools. These ambitions are often noble, and they can be good for
          public relations, but they are not always value-enhancing, and studies have shown that
          many are value-destroying for shareholders”</marquage> (p. 100). Investors will then have
          to assume a cost related to the implementation of philanthropic actions. Our results are
          also in line with the conclusions of Igalens (2007); Kim <marquage typemarq="italique">et al.,</marquage> (2012); Platet-Pierrot and Giordano-Spring (2011). Finally, the main
          finding relates that the discourse within responsibility reports may reveal itself to be
          an internal moderator of the CSP and CFP relationship, in the sense of Grewatsch and
          Kleindienst (2017). Indeed, from an instrumental CSR perspective, the involvement of
          managers is crucial, and the discourse might reveal if firms properly manage CSR
          expenditures to improve their financial performance. The reading of the sustainability
          reports gives us information on the company’s use and perception of the CSR notion. It is
          essential to avoid entrenchment strategy from managers and greenwashing. Thus, we strongly
          encourage the use of these reports. This free and available information can be used to
          complement asset selection methods when building financially efficient and socially
          responsible portfolios.</alinea>

        <alinea>As an extension of this study, it could be interesting to develop, on the one hand,
          a longitudinal approach to identify fashion effects in speeches and to avoid possible
          biases related to the choice of our analysis period. In fact, the link between CSR and
          financial performance seems to be stronger during bearish markets (Ducassy, 2013). On the
          other hand, it could also be interesting to develop the idea of an internal moderator of
          the discourse employed, seeking to measure this effect in a direct and not implicit way.
          Finally, it could be enlightening to focus on a particular sector in order to better
          understand the link between the discourse, the level of CSR and the financial performance,
          as suggested in Shalchian <marquage typemarq="italique">et al.,</marquage> (2015). This
          would make it possible to develop a complete model for selecting financially responsible
          and efficient assets and to be part of a more balanced approach based on the overall
          responsible profile rather than a simple exclusionary policy.</alinea>

        <alinea>To ensure the robustness of our results, other financial performance measures have
          been used, such as the Treynor and Sortino ratios. Due to a very high correlation, greater
          than 0.87, our results did not show significant differences. We therefore preferred the
          use of the Sharpe ratio that takes into account the overall risk of assets, knowing that
          it’s difficult to responsibly diversify financial portfolios due to a more restrictive
          universe of available assets.</alinea>
