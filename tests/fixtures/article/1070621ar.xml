      <alinea>This essay sets out to solve the strange case of the “disappearance” of the Poet
        Laureate, Robert Southey, in his own 1829 book of “imaginary conversations” or
          <marquage typemarq="italique">Colloquies</marquage> with the ghost of Sir Thomas More. There is no “Southey” in the
        dialogue, only a figure named “Montesinos.” But since the pessimistic ghost of More
        evidently speaks for Southey—as readers from the <marquage typemarq="italique">Westminster Review</marquage> in summer 1829
        onwards have noticed—then the dialogue is strangely one-sided. If More is Southey, then
        “who,” as Mark Storey’s biography asks, “is Montesinos?” This essay seeks to answer Storey’s
        biographical question, and to put it into the wider context of Southey’s ideas about
        national and writerly identity, and his Romantic poetics of history. The first part explores
        “Montesinos” as a byword for Southey’s literary utopianism. The second part then attempts
        the resurrection of “Montesinos,” tracing this figure in the detail of Southey’s “Hispanist”
        reading and in the workings of his historical imagination. I conclude with reflections on
        the implications of Southey’s ‘hieroglyphic’ mode of life-writing for historicist approaches
        to Romantic studies today, including the ‘new counterfactualism’ and the ‘speculative
        revivals’ of ‘Romantic biography’.</alinea>

        <alinea>Robert Southey’s ghost-dialogue, <marquage typemarq="italique">Sir Thomas More: or,
            Colloquies on Society</marquage> (1829), presents itself as an English literary
          history—in a richly compound sense. In one of the central colloquies, the “spiritual
          visitor” Thomas More asks what it is to be “English at heart,” and evinces his own feeling
          for the “old house” of the constitution (<marquage typemarq="italique">STM</marquage> 192,
          258). A presiding “national” character also appears on the face of the book, seen in the
          Old English type used for the main title, in the frontispiece engraving, after Hans
          Holbein’s 1527 portrait of More as a privy councillor (see figure 1), and in the laureate
          poem manqué, the “Dedication.” “Robert Southey, Esq. LL.D. <marquage typemarq="italique">Poet Laureate</marquage>” features on the title page with the full list of his honours:

          Greta Hall, and among “these lakes and mountains” (<marquage typemarq="italique">STM</marquage> 2). The “northern parts” of the English Lakes, with “little or nothing”
          to show “of historical or romantic interest” (<marquage typemarq="italique">STM</marquage>

            require. From America? I replied, rising to salute him. …You judge of me, he made

        <alinea>The earliest readers were jolted out of this deepening field of “national” feeling,
          however, by the “foreign” brush-hair in the canvas: “Montesinos.” The un-English name was
          echoed back to Southey by the editors of <marquage typemarq="italique">Blackwood’s</marquage><marquage typemarq="italique"> Magazine</marquage>—his professed
          allies in “anti-Catholic[ism]” and “friends[hip]” to the “Church of England”—as
          “Misopseudos” (<marquage typemarq="italique">Noctes Ambrosianae</marquage>, no. 47, see
            <marquage typemarq="italique">STM </marquage>748-774, 759, 774). Southey’s friend, the
          Parliamentary official and census-taker John Rickman, meanwhile, referred to the
          “outlandish Spanish name”—which was also likely to be “understood by few” (John Rickman to
          Robert Southey, January 14, 1831, <marquage typemarq="italique">RLL</marquage> 272). For
          Rickman, interested in watchwords for “incognito” publication, and in defending government
          based on “influence,” an incomprehensible name might be none the worse for that (<marquage typemarq="italique">Selections </marquage>IV 367-369; <marquage typemarq="italique">RLL</marquage> 259-260, 271-272). But Southey as a professional author could not afford
          to be quite so sanguine. It was “always desirable to have a peculiar title,” he told
          Caroline Bowles in January 1826, with his own sequel-generating <marquage typemarq="italique">Book of the Church</marquage> (1824) in mind, since the “name”
          quickly came to stand in for the thing itself (<marquage typemarq="italique">CRSCB</marquage> 95-6). But the reviewer of an advance copy of <marquage typemarq="italique">Colloquies</marquage> for the <marquage typemarq="italique">Literary
            Gazette</marquage> had, he complained to Caroline in April 1829, been so blinded by the
          peculiarity of “Montesinos” as not only to miss any more refined levels of reference, but
          to garble the overall allusion to <marquage typemarq="italique">Hamlet</marquage>: “giving
          as a specimen an extract altogether unlike any other part of the book, and explaining
          Montesinos to mean a stranger from a distant country! And these are the critics upon whose
          good or ill report the sale of a book among book societies mainly depends!” (<marquage typemarq="italique">CRSCB</marquage> 156).</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa3"><no>3</no>
        <alinea>To those in the know, “Montesinos” might suggest a re-doubling of the transparently
          English “Spaniard” of Southey’s <marquage typemarq="italique">Letters from England, by Don
            Manuel Alvarez Espriella</marquage> (1807). Writing from the point of view of Espriella,
          an “able” but “bigoted” Spaniard whose historiography features “bloody Elizabeth” and the
          “sunshine of Philip and Mary’s reign” (<marquage typemarq="italique">LFE</marquage> 196,
          200), Southey correlated two national “times” or “states” and subverted two national myths
          at once. Espriella “discovers” in England “such symptoms of a declining power as may
          soothe the national inferiority, which he cannot but feel” (<marquage typemarq="italique">Selections</marquage> I 282). Southey’s friend and fellow Anglican polemicist, Blanco
          White (born José María Blanco y Crespo), had sought his advice and taken his <marquage typemarq="italique">Espriella’s Letters</marquage> as a model when developing his own
          Spanish-English figure in <marquage typemarq="italique">Letters from Spain, by Don
            Leucadio Doblado</marquage> (1822; see <marquage typemarq="italique">CLRS</marquage>
          1978). Explaining the name in this title to mean “whiteness doubled,” Blanco’s preface to
          the second edition of 1825 put a further spin on the “Hispanist” play of pseudonymy that
          Southey—“leading the way in a mania for Spanish subjects” since 1797 (<marquage typemarq="italique">LFE</marquage> 19)—had begun. As Carol Bolton notes, building on the
          work of Diego Saglia and Tim Fulford, Spain figured in late-eighteenth and
          early-nineteenth century British writing as a sort of movable South, by which to set the
          sliders of Englishness: alternately the “rapacious imperialist” “other” of the “mild,
          commercial British,” and the site of “kindred … national loyalties, once Spain had been
          drawn into the war against France” (<marquage typemarq="italique">LFE</marquage> 17).
          Situating himself within this tradition, Blanco insisted that the false name, understood
          rightly, was actually a token of “complete authenticity.” The adoptive Englishman lived
          “perfectly at variance” from his “countrymen,” Blanco suggested, having been “forced”
          himself by the linguistic insularity of the English to live under a tautologous name
          (White iv).</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa4"><no>4</no>
        <alinea>Just such a “perfect” national “variance” is visible in each of the apparently
          straightforwardly “English” features on the face of the <marquage typemarq="italique">Colloquies</marquage>. The presiding presence of Thomas More, the English Catholic
          minister of state and European diplomat, executed for refusing the royal supremacy, gives
          a personal form to the urgent contemporary “question” of Catholic Emancipation, and the
          looming challenge to what Southey’s preface refers to as “the Protestant Constitution of
          these kingdoms” (<marquage typemarq="italique">STM</marquage> lxxxv). But by continually
          invoking More’s <marquage typemarq="italique">Utopia</marquage> (1516), and seeding
          various allusions in his text to More’s status as a forefather of European political
          union, signatory to the 1518 “Treaty of London,” or of “Universal Peace” (see <marquage typemarq="italique">STM </marquage>385-393, 668 n. 773), Southey suggests the
          European—on the way to the “global”—dimensions of Englishness.</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa5"><no>5</no>
        <alinea>“The Dedication,” meanwhile, meditates at length on Holbein’s image of More in his
          prime as a “prophetic counterfeit” of Southey’s uncle the Rev. Herbert Hill, who had spent
          a quarter of a century overseas in Portugal (1782–1807), and died shortly before <marquage typemarq="italique">Colloquies</marquage> was published, in 1828. The king’s councillor
          of the 1520s “prefigure[s] thus,” says Southey, the “benevolen[t]” “mien” of the Anglican
          chaplain of the Lisbon factory in the 1790s (<marquage typemarq="italique">STM
          </marquage>lxxix-lxxxiii; ll. 14, 31-34). The picture and the poem combine to articulate
          the central historiographical theme of the <marquage typemarq="italique">Colloquies</marquage>—that curious matter and randomly “found” facts or personal
          experiences gradually form into meaningful historical shapes. But the poem concludes by
          imagining for Herbert Hill another kind of virtual second life, spanning the Atlantic and
          translated into the form of Southey’s library “labours” as (Luso-)Hispanist and historian.
          If he can yet “consummat[e]” his and Herbert’s thirty-year joint project to write the
          global history of Portugal—a land “nor yet / To be despair’d of, for not yet, methinks, /
          Degenerate wholly”—then, Southey hopes, </alinea>

        <alinea>Alluding to the <marquage typemarq="italique">Lusiad</marquage> (1572), the
          Portuguese national epic of Luis Vaz de Camões, and to geographical descriptions (of the
          Planalto Central, the Plata, and the Amazon) in his own three-volume <marquage typemarq="italique">History of Brazil</marquage> (1810-19; see <marquage typemarq="italique">STM</marquage> 524-525 n. 34), Southey ultimately “dedicates” the
            <marquage typemarq="italique">Colloquies</marquage> not to “the Protestant Constitution”
            (<marquage typemarq="italique">STM </marquage>lxxxv), but to his longstanding and
          consistent view of Spain, Portugal, and South America as the lands of historical destiny.
          In his <marquage typemarq="italique">Letters Written During a Short Residence in Spain and
            Portugal </marquage>(1797), Southey had suggested that neither nation had “attained to
          the aera of Taste” that should have followed their “short and rapid” “rise” to the “aera
          of Genius.” But though they had “languished” long under “the double tyranny of their Kings
          and Priests,” there was life in the embers of both nations (125-126). When Napoleon
          invaded Portugal in 1807, and the monarchy fled to the old colony of Brazil, Southey
          perceived the recrudescence of an historical opportunity (missed by England and the USA):
          to forge a lasting blend of old and new worlds, to “temper” monarchy “with a wholesome
          mixture of democracy” (<marquage typemarq="italique">HoB</marquage> III 870). Being a
          place “where good laws, and good old customs, have only fallen into disuse,” as Southey
          put it in his <marquage typemarq="italique">History of Brazil </marquage>(III 870),
          Luso-America seemed to offer the historian the opportunity, in turn, as Mark Storey puts
          it, to “shape the future” (<marquage typemarq="italique">Contexts</marquage>,

        <alinea><marquage typemarq="italique">Colloquies</marquage> develops this historical concept
          at length, connecting the South American past and future with the English past and
          present. The dialogues between More and Montesinos feature repeated imaginary “excursions”
          from Keswick to the “Chiquito [and] Paraguay Reductions” of the Jesuits—from the Greta to
          “the Guapore and the Uruguay” (<marquage typemarq="italique">STM</marquage> 79). But the
          kind of “perfect variance” thus suggested between Southey and the “More” and “Montesinos”
          of the <marquage typemarq="italique">Colloquies</marquage> was immediately ruled out of
          bounds by Thomas Macaulay. In his “classic” essay on <marquage typemarq="italique">Colloquies</marquage> in the <marquage typemarq="italique">Edinburgh Review</marquage>,
          Macaulay pronounced the name “Montesinos” “somewhat affected,” while the calling-in of Sir
          Thomas More “to say what any man might have said” was simply “grotesque” (<marquage typemarq="italique">STM</marquage> 794, 843). “What a contrast,” he exclaimed, between
          this “monkish” and “absurd fiction” of a ghost-dialogue with a “great” Tudor “statesman
          and philosopher,” and the dialogue form as practiced by Plato and Cicero (<marquage typemarq="italique">STM</marquage> 790-794). Southey’s two long volumes, Macaulay
          suggested, were merely “an amplification” of two “absurd paragraphs” in Colloquy X on the
          interfusion of the two (actually quite separate) issues of religion and education, cast
          into the equally “absurd” form of a conversation between what was in reality just “two
          Southeys” (<marquage typemarq="italique">STM </marquage>193-194, 802, 794).</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa7"><no>7</no>
        <alinea>Macaulay’s comments were themselves an “amplification” of Francis Jeffrey’s earlier
          attacks on Southey’s “outlandish” works and characters: <marquage typemarq="italique">Thalaba</marquage> (1801), a “tissue of adventures,” strung together with a heroic
          cipher, and <marquage typemarq="italique">Espriella’s Letters </marquage>(1807), a mere
          “deception,” “sp[u]n out” to cover a lack of “native ingenuity” (<marquage typemarq="italique">RSCH</marquage> 84, 121-122). In the <marquage typemarq="italique">Wat Tyler </marquage>affair of 1817, William Hazlitt joined in with the character
          assassination initiated by William Smith, MP in the House of Commons, reading the pirated
          text of the 1794 play by the young radical medievalist against the unsigned essay on
          reform that the laureate had just published in the conservative <marquage typemarq="italique">Quarterly Review</marquage>. Pitting “the one” Southey against “the
          other,” Hazlitt produced a caricature of the Wordsworthian “theory of personal
          continuity”: the foolish “Ultra-royalist” “man” appearing as the superannuated “child” of
          the “Ultra-jacobin” and “effeminate” “son” (“Two Reviews”). Southey’s self-vindicating
            <marquage typemarq="italique">Letter to William Smith</marquage> (1817) only proved the
          point. Arguing best “when he argues against himself,” Southey was a “painful hieroglyphic
          of humanity” (<marquage typemarq="italique">SWWH</marquage> IV 193). And in <marquage typemarq="italique">The</marquage>
          <marquage typemarq="italique">Spirit of the Age </marquage>(1825), Hazlitt finished his
          portrait of the laureate as a man almost entirely without inwardness, but profoundly
          “unsettled”—“born an age too late”—by “the distraction of the time” (<marquage typemarq="italique">SWWH </marquage>VII 216-218). Superficially engine-turned, able to
          switch genres and subjects “by a stop-watch,” Southey nevertheless remained a radical at
          heart: “wild, singular, irregular, extreme.” “No man can entirely baulk his nature: it
          breaks out in spite of him.” And it was, paradoxically, Southey’s “unremitting” and
          “mechanical” attempt to route his radical “nature” entirely through an accumulation of
          surface texture that made him for Hazlitt a sort of “hieroglyphic” of the spirit of the
          age: his works the “trances” rather “than the waking dreams” of Romantic poetry.</alinea>

        <alinea>Recalling these attacks on Southey’s ill-formed “plans” and distorted character and
          career, and perhaps anticipating Coleridge’s 1832 comments on having “no admiration for
          the practice of ventriloquizing through another man’s mouth,” Macaulay pictured the
            <marquage typemarq="italique">Colloquies</marquage> as a “picturesque” and bizarrely
          nostalgic ramble through a hundred random subjects, patched together between two
          non-entities (<marquage typemarq="italique">STM </marquage>792-794, 797; <marquage typemarq="italique">TT</marquage> I 308-309). Between, that is, a travesty of Thomas
          More—“the glorified spirit” reduced to “a bilious old Nabob”—on the one hand, and the
          nothing-man of “Montesinos, as Mr. Southey somewhat affectedly calls himself,” on the
          other (<marquage typemarq="italique">STM</marquage> 794, and qtd. 843).</alinea>

        <alinea>“Affected” the pseudonym might have been, but out of keeping with its genres of
          dialogue and utopia it was not. In utopian writing, as Gregory Claeys points out, names
          matter (Claeys 57). Claeys makes the point in relation to the title of one of the various
          pseudo-sequels to Southey’s book—the Owenite philanthropist John Minter Morgan’s <marquage typemarq="italique">Hampden in the Nineteenth Century: or,</marquage>
          <marquage typemarq="italique">Colloquies on the Errors and Improvement of Society
          </marquage>(1834). But Morgan’s book also includes a fictional episode that expands—even
          as it seems to solve—the mystery of “Montesinos.” Repeating the real-life visit of his
          mentor, Robert Owen, in summer 1816, Morgan’s narrator, Fitzosborne, comes to Keswick
          hoping to discuss the laureate’s ongoing work on social progress and on Sir Thomas More.
          He is disturbed to find, however, that no such individual is known there, and to be
          directed instead to “a gentleman” who walks “beside the lake with a volume in his hand,”
          called “Montesinos” (II 28). Visiting his house and library, and reading a manuscript
          containing “dialogues” between “Montesinos” and “Sir Thomas More,” Fitzosborne leaps to
          the conclusion that his unknown “host” must be the figure precisely absent in the text:
          “none other than Robert Southey himself.” Southey had clearly “assumed the name of
          Montesinos,” though “for what reason I could not divine” (II 28-31).</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa10"><no>10</no>
        <alinea>Readings like Morgan’s suggest the inadequacy of Macaulay’s flat suggestion of two
          simply interchangeable “Southeys.” Indeed, the passage singled out by Macaulay, featuring
          More’s “absurd” words on the state “secure in proportion as the people are attached to its
          institutions” (<marquage typemarq="italique">STM </marquage>193-194), suggests something
          quite different again. For these words are <marquage typemarq="italique">exactly</marquage> the words of Southey himself—repeated almost verbatim from a
          pamphlet and <marquage typemarq="italique">Quarterly Review</marquage> essay of 1811-12
          (Southey 1812 106–107; <marquage typemarq="italique">QR </marquage>6:11 [1811] 289). If
          “Sir Thomas More” is thus evidently, as Mark Storey puts it, “often Southey’s own
          mouthpiece,” articulating opinions that had been his own since the 1810s, then Storey’s
          follow-up question, “who is Montesinos?,” gains a real literary-biographical point (Storey
          316). Or rather, since “Montesinos” is evidently—to combine Morgan, Hazlitt and
          Macaulay—the “other Southey,” the question now becomes: “… and <marquage typemarq="italique">who</marquage>—by 1829—was <marquage typemarq="italique">that</marquage>?”</alinea>

        <alinea>This essay seeks to answer Storey’s question. The second part attempts the detailed
          resurrection of “Montesinos,” seeking to trace this figure in the workings of Southey’s
          historical imagination. But before turning to this work, which might otherwise seem as
          abstruse as the name “Montesinos” itself, I want to indicate the larger context in which
          the academic or biographical question resonates. Southey’s belief in the importance of
          “peculiar titles” reflects an overarching and life-long preoccupation with emblems, catch
          phrases, and catachresis in general. The habit goes at least as far back as <marquage typemarq="italique">The Flagellant</marquage> in 1792, the school magazine in which
          Southey wrote against corporal punishment as “Gualbertus”—a name adapted from John
          Gualbert (c. 995–1073), founder of the Vallombrosian order (see <marquage typemarq="italique">CLRS</marquage> 28). It also went at least as far forward as
          Southey’s “incognito” Shandean novel or “disguised diary,” <marquage typemarq="italique">The Doctor</marquage> (see <marquage typemarq="italique">Selections</marquage> IV
          367-369; and Chandler 616-617). In preparation for this project, Southey sat to his friend
          the artist Edward Nash (1778–1821) for a “<marquage typemarq="italique">back</marquage>
          portrait” or “reariture”.</alinea>

        <alinea>The image was used, eventually, as frontispiece to the posthumous one-volume edition
          of 1848, with the disarming caption, “Portrait of the Author” (see <marquage typemarq="italique">CLRS</marquage> 3607, 3637). Southey’s alter-egos were thus always
          as much self-revelation as disguise, with something of the “perfect variance” of “Leucadio
          Doblado”—or what Jacques Derrida, reading the Ghost scenes in <marquage typemarq="italique">Hamlet</marquage>, refers to as the “visor effect” of
          “dissimulation” to an unknowable, though possibly total, extent (7-8). At the very start
          of the <marquage typemarq="italique">Colloquies</marquage> project in late 1817, while
          “Montesinos” was still in the embryonic form of “meipsum,” Southey considered reviving the
          “assumed character” of “Espriella,” since it had allowed him to speak freely both “in” and
          “thro” the disguise, leaving his true view “to the readers sagacity to discover”
            (<marquage typemarq="italique">CLRS</marquage> 3051).</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa12"><no>12</no>
        <alinea>The “assumed character” provided useful political cover. But recent criticism also
          suggests a possible reading of Southey’s various acts of cryptic self-reference, and what
          he referred to as their “strict etymological yet non-apparent relations” (<marquage typemarq="italique">Selections</marquage> IV 205-206), in terms of the emergent
          “depthless” complexity (“either unimaginably deep or having no depth at all”) of what
          Seamus Perry calls the “exoskeletal,” and Andrew Warren the “arabesque” mode—of Southey’s
          own variety of Romanticism (see Morton 59; Perry 18-19; Warren 54-59). The locus classicus
          for this Southeyan mode of speaking truth “in” and “thro” a disguise is the exotic epic
            <marquage typemarq="italique">Thalaba </marquage>(1801). Here, as both Tim Fulford and
          Andrew Warren suggest, Southey set himself the impossible task of contriving an English
          work of Islamic mythology with all the “purities of Poetry”—“pure truth, pure language,
          and pure manners” (Preface to <marquage typemarq="italique">Madoc</marquage> [1805]
            <marquage typemarq="italique">EPW</marquage> II 6)—even while, “[s]peaking no eastern
          language, knowing no Orientalist scholars,” he was constrained to “discern” his inward
          essence of Islam from in amongst a flood of fanciful translations, imitations, and
          forgeries (<marquage typemarq="italique">EPW</marquage> III x; Warren 54). At the
          micro-level of local texture, meanwhile, the model is again <marquage typemarq="italique">Thalaba</marquage>, and Okba’s rebuke to the Dom-Danielites, where the contortion of
          the sign-system both creates and subverts, with the hanging force of “he,” the idea of an
          inert and self-sufficient sign: “Ye frown as if my hasty fault, / My ill-directed blow /
          Had spared the enemy, / And not the Stars that would not give, / And not your feeble
          spells / That could not force, the sign / Which of the whole was he” (II 67-73; see also
          Warren 66). The Southeyan “forced sign” is a sort of depthless-ecological or
          “hieroglyphic” answer to the embodied interiority of Wordsworth’s “spots of time”; De
          Quincey’s “involute” not “carried far” but interrupted—a tattoo—at the level of the skin

        <alinea>This became Southey’s lasting self-image. In 1817, he had Longmans advertise the
          second volume of his <marquage typemarq="italique">History of Brazil </marquage>(1810-19)
          with the would-be “mortifying” comment of a reviewer in the <marquage typemarq="italique">Monthly </marquage>on the first: “we like him (Mr. Southey) much better as an Historian
          than as a Poet” (<marquage typemarq="italique">CLRS</marquage> 2940). And the global-poet
          or “better historian” appears further transfigured in <marquage typemarq="italique">Colloquies</marquage> (1829)—under the pressure of More’s critique of the “portentous
          bibliolatry of the age” (<marquage typemarq="italique">STM </marquage>19)—as the
          potentially all-seeing “man of letters.” “For whom is the purest honey hoarded that the
          bees of this world elaborate,” asks “Montesinos” the “gray-headed bookman” (<marquage typemarq="italique">STM </marquage>370) in Colloquy XIV, “The Library,” “if it be not

        <alinea>The term eco-historicism, coined (albeit with a different inflection) by Gillen
          D’Arcy Wood in 2008, might thus be the right one to apply to this writer—who can often be
          seen in his letters pushing past his contemporary and historical sources to the next,
          “ecological” thought (see D’Arcy Wood 2008 1-7; and Morton 1-19). Tambora, which erupted
          in 1815, was a name as yet unknown. But Southey’s letters of November and December 1817
          show him assembling fragments of information from newspapers and correspondents, and
          arriving almost simultaneously at an understanding of the dark heart of what D’Arcy Wood
          calls the “Years Without a Summer … 1816, 1817, and 1818,” in terms of “some great
          convulsion,” a “Volcano,” and also in terms of a ghost “returning” from a

        <alinea>The text of <marquage typemarq="italique">Colloquies</marquage> contains suggestions
          of an interestingly conflicted version of the latter. It is nostalgia for Cintra,
          Portugal, that Southey says attaches him to the Lakes, and, in particular, to the
          “Goldilocks” prospect (reached with “just” the right “degree” of “difficulty and
          enterprize”) over Walla Crag. The scene—reenacted at length in John Minter Morgan’s
          sub-sequel (Morgan II 35-45)—is summoned into presence as a “virtual topography,” in Tim
          Fulford’s phrase (2010, §29). A complex “involution” of time and space occurs in amongst
          Southey’s description of his viewing and reading habits, William Westall’s drawing of the
          scene that features Southey himself (see figure 4), and then the re-entrance of the
          ghost:</alinea>

            summer and autumn which I passed at Cintra, in the morning of life and hope, the
            perpetual gurgling of its tanks and fountains occurs among the vivid recollections of
            that earthly Paradise as one of its charms. When I had satisfied myself with the

          What exactly is “apprehended” in these gnomic statements? The seven-word exchange,
          following More’s already terse evocation of a “dynamic” historical parallel, is an apt
          epitome of Southey’s views on style: “perspicuous,” “brief,” “rememberable” (<marquage typemarq="italique">CLRS</marquage> 1670). The exchange of phrases mimes Southey’s
          effort to match More for “historical” compression. “Utopia,” as Southey notes in the scene
          of reading at Walla Crag, is the grand archetype of the “winged word”: “understood by
          thousands and tens of thousands who have never read the fiction from whence it is derived”
            (<marquage typemarq="italique">STM</marquage> 71). Drawing attention to the way the book
          (in fact) survives the man, and the word (or <marquage typemarq="italique">concept</marquage>) outgrows the work, Southey suggests the genuine historiographical
          gain in what appears to be only historical loss. And as Montesinos sets “Utopia” within a
          constellation of further allusions—to Spenser and to the <marquage typemarq="italique">memento mori</marquage> paintings of Guercino and Poussin, via the classical tag
            “<marquage typemarq="italique">Et in Arcadia ego</marquage>”—he suggests the historical
          burden that has come to attach to utopianism itself. It takes immense strength—Montesinos
          seems to imply—to wear so much learning so lightly. But More’s speech in the exchange also
          seems to predict T.S. Eliot’s response on behalf of the “dead writers”—who indeed knew
          less than us, because “they are that which we know” (Eliot 40): “<marquage typemarq="italique">Et in Utopiâ ego</marquage>”—Yes, precisely—“You apprehend <marquage typemarq="italique">me</marquage>.”</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa16"><no>16</no>
        <alinea>Identifying himself by way of an oblique compound allusion, rather than by a direct
          statement, “Montesinos” may seem to be entirely a “man of letters” in Byron’s—and
          Burke’s—more negative sense (see Byron’s journal entry, November 22, 1813, <marquage typemarq="italique">RSCH</marquage> 157). So completely stuffed with print, he seems to
          have forgotten how—unlike Burke’s “unsophisticated … untaught” English—to “feel within”
          (Burke 70-77). But the “<marquage typemarq="italique">Et in utopia</marquage>” phrase also
          has a specific history of its own that suggests the opposite. It is in fact recycled in
            <marquage typemarq="italique">Colloquies</marquage> from the autobiographical context of
          the visits that Southey received in 1816 and 1817 from the philanthropic industrialist
          Robert Owen, and his own return visit to Owen and the model industrial settlement at New
          Lanark in 1819. With his “tin case full of plans,” Owen in Keswick in 1816 had seemed to
          the laureate like the risen spirit of a former self, the “odd personage” striking him as
          just “such a Pantisocrat as I was” (<marquage typemarq="italique">CLRS</marquage> 2832).
          But as Southey recorded in his private journal, it was the sight of Owen’s practical
          “utopia” during his 1819 tour of Scotland that led to the more profound
          self-discovery:</alinea>
        <bloccitation>
          <alinea>Owen in reality deceives himself. … <marquage typemarq="italique">Et in Utopiâ

            mould (like the other parts of his mill) and take the impression with perfect certainty.
            …He keeps out of sight from others, and perhaps from himself, that his system, instead
            of aiming at perfect freedom, can only be kept in play by absolute power. …The <marquage typemarq="italique">formation of character</marquage>! Why the end of his institutions
            would be, as far as possible, the destruction of all character.</alinea>

        </bloccitation>
        <alinea>Pushing his analysis beyond the “scruples” of radicals such as William Cobbett about
          “parallelograms of paupers,” Southey arrives here at what Robert Davis and Frank O’Hagan
          call “a fundamental disclosure of the hidden … mainspring” of utopias in the need for
          “infinite jurisdiction” (see Davis and O’Hagan 174-175; and <marquage typemarq="italique">Political Register</marquage>, 2 August 1817). The phrase “<marquage typemarq="italique">Et in Utopiâ ego</marquage>” thus represents its own opposite: The
          perfect inward variance of the figure of “Montesinos” from the intersection of
          biographical and historical planes that combine to “name” the presence within the text of
          the undeceived author himself, and from the “formation” and “destruction” in the long
          years since pantisocracy of his own original character.</alinea>

        <alinea>So, to put the question again: If Sir Thomas More (<marquage typemarq="italique">mutatis mutandis</marquage>) is Southey, and Montesinos is “the other one,” then what,
          specifically, might Southey have meant by that? What, in short, were the meanings it was
          possible to read into or out of the name? A “Spanish name” for “mountaineer” or “man of
          the mountains,” “Montesinos” evidently reflects Southey’s Hispanist second life, giving a
          personal form to his wide-ranging interests in the medieval history and literature of
          Spain and Portugal, as well as his fascination with dreams and alter-egos (Speck,
            <marquage typemarq="italique">Contexts</marquage> 203-217). Southey taking the name
          “Montesinos” might be twinning himself with (already self-twinned) Blanco White—in knowing
          Spain, Portugal, and Catholicism from the inside out. But the pairing of this
          anti-Catholic figure—“no more […] a pupil of the Jesuits” (<marquage typemarq="italique">STM </marquage>364)—with the near-sainted Sir Thomas More, suggests what Southey in one
          of his recurring “Catholic” dreams called a certain “staggering” of his “Protestantism”
          (qtd. Speck, <marquage typemarq="italique">Contexts</marquage> 214). The apparently
          “English” perspective of the <marquage typemarq="italique">Colloquies</marquage> is
          peppered with repeated references—usually in the voice of “Montesinos”—to the history and
          the constitution of the Society of Jesus, and to their “most imperfect of Utopias” in the
          Paraguay Reductions (<marquage typemarq="italique">STM </marquage>62, 79, 123, 147-148,
          200, 208, 224, 318-319, 333, 344-345, 347). The only real textual crux in the <marquage typemarq="italique">Colloquies</marquage> occurs—perhaps significantly—at the moment
          when Montesinos implicitly denies belonging to the Society (<marquage typemarq="italique">STM </marquage>364-365).<renvoi id="re1no4" idref="no4" typeref="note">4</renvoi> Southey’s contemporaries
          lacked the access to his dream-book—full of “living monuments” of saints, architectural
          visions of hell, and invocations of “Jesus and St. Ignatius Loyola!”—that might have made
            <marquage typemarq="italique">Colloquies</marquage> legible not only as a Burkean lament
          for the loss of “old instinctive belief” (<marquage typemarq="italique">STM</marquage>
          2-3), but as a sort of Catholic lucid dream (see Speck, <marquage typemarq="italique">Contexts</marquage> 213-216; <marquage typemarq="italique">STM</marquage> 2-3; and
          reviews in the <marquage typemarq="italique">Westminster</marquage> and <marquage typemarq="italique">Examiner</marquage> in <marquage typemarq="italique">STM</marquage>
          708-726, 711, 725). But by the 1820s even friends such as Charles Lamb detected a
          “noteable inconsistency” in writings that both paraded and debunked the “imposing rites”
          of “our Popish brethren”: “You pick up pence by showing the hallowed bones, shrine, and
          crucifix; and you take money a second time by exposing the trick of them afterwards” (qtd.

      </para><para id="pa18"><no>18</no>
        <alinea>Possibly reflecting all levels of this “inconsistency,” the apparently abstruse name
          of “Montesinos” certainly reflects the scholarly and cosmopolitan flavour of Southey’s
          interests as historian and poet. But it is also shorthand for Southey’s claim to full
          fellowship among the “Lake Poets,” to being as much a denizen of the visionary mountain
          republic as Wordsworth or Coleridge—but in his own particular way. These meanings are
          implicit in Southey’s comment to Rickman, in the midst of work on the unpublished “Second
          Series” of <marquage typemarq="italique">Colloquies </marquage>on January 14, 1831, that
          “The man of the mountains will interpolate his speeches, largely &amp; loquaciously enough

        <alinea>The obvious literary source is the “Cave of Montesinos” episode (in chapters 22-23)
          in Miguel de Cervantes’s <marquage typemarq="italique">Don Quixote </marquage>(1605).
          Southey owned three editions of the <marquage typemarq="italique">Quixote</marquage>, two
          of which date from the early seventeenth century and are rare or (translated) first
            editions.<renvoi id="re1no5" idref="no5" typeref="note">5</renvoi> In 1807, Southey had discussions with
          Longmans about re-editing the “old edition” with Thomas Shelton’s translation (<marquage typemarq="italique">CLRS</marquage> 1354 and 1356). This project came to nothing, but
          Southey would have been aware of other contemporary editions, including John Gibson
          Lockhart’s 1822 edition using Motteux’s “spirited” rather than Shelton’s “obsolete”
          translation—which Lockhart took over from Walter Scott, as Southey had done with his 1817
          edition of the <marquage typemarq="italique">Morte D’Arthur </marquage>(see Lang
          307-308).</alinea>

        <alinea>In <marquage typemarq="italique">Don Quixote</marquage>, old man Montesinos appears
          to the hero in his dream in the cave, and leads him into a crystal palace, where he
          confirms the ballad legend that he cut out the heart of his dying friend, Durandarte, and
          delivered it to his friend’s mistress, Belerma. Montesinos further relates that he and his
          companions are “kept here enchanted by Merlin that British magician, who, they say, was
          the son of the Devil … how and for what cause no man can tell” (Lockhart ed. IV 71-74).
          Various companions, meanwhile, have undergone metamorphoses: “Ruydera (the lady’s woman)
          with her seven daughters, her two nieces … were turned into so many lakes … [Durandarte’s]
          squire Guadiana … was in like manner metamorphosed into a river.” In a passage rich with
          resonances for Southey, Montesinos expands on the fate of Gaudiana: “Those lakes mixing
          their waters in his bosom, he swells, and glides along in sullen state to Portugal, often
          expressing his deep melancholy by the muddy and turbid colour of his streams” (Lockhart
          ed. IV 75-76).</alinea>

        <alinea>But this literary source for Southey’s alter ego was already a composite point of
          reference. The entry for “Montesinos” in William Wheeler’s <marquage typemarq="italique">Dictionary of the Noted Names of Fiction</marquage> (1866)—which draws on John Gibson
          Lockhart’s annotations—defines the name thus:</alinea>

            mountain, forest. A legendary hero whose history and adventures are described in the
            ballads and romances of chivalry. Having received some cause of offence at the French
            court, he is said to have retired into Spain, where, from his fondness for wild and
            mountainous scenery, he acquired the name by which he became so celebrated, and which
            has been given to a cavern in the heart of La Mancha, supposed to have been inhabited by
            him. This cavern has been immortalized by Cervantes in his account of the visit of Don
            Quixote to the Cave of Montesinos.</alinea>

        <alinea>Southey would have been well aware of the complex literary legend behind the
          Montesinos episode in <marquage typemarq="italique">Don Quixote</marquage>, having
          immersed himself in old Spanish ballads and romances for Hispanist works including
            <marquage typemarq="italique">Amadis of Gaul </marquage>(1803), <marquage typemarq="italique">Palmerin of England </marquage>(1807), the <marquage typemarq="italique">Chronicle of the Cid </marquage>(1808), and <marquage typemarq="italique">Roderick, the Last of the Goths</marquage> (1814). The name
          Montesinos thus links the <marquage typemarq="italique">Colloquies </marquage>into a
          Cervantic and larger “Romantic” literary tradition. But it is also from the beginning—in
          Lockhart’s telling, at least—less a name denoting true identity than a Spanish mask
          adopted in retreat, a name <marquage typemarq="italique">applied to</marquage> a
          “legendary hero” who haunts “wild and mountainous scenery” after “retiring” from the
          public affairs of France. The legend resonates with Southey’s own career: The birth of his
          public conservative persona coincided with the inception of the <marquage typemarq="italique">Quarterly Review</marquage>, in reaction to the notorious claim of
          the <marquage typemarq="italique">Edinburgh</marquage> that the 1808 Iberian uprising
          against Napoleon—and British sympathy with it—was the risen (and righteous) ghost of 1789
          (see <marquage typemarq="italique">ER </marquage>13 [1808] 222-223; <marquage typemarq="italique">CLRS</marquage> 1596).</alinea>

        <alinea>Montesinos the Carolingian knight is a significant figure in the <marquage typemarq="italique">Romancero General</marquage>, and he was well represented in English
          translations of Spanish ballad literature. Montesinos is the focus of three ballads in
          Thomas Rodd’s <marquage typemarq="italique">Ancient Ballads from the Civil Wars of
            Granada, and the Twelve Peers of France </marquage>(1801), of eight ballads included in
          Rodd’s subsequent <marquage typemarq="italique">History of Charles the Great and Orlando,

            Mentioned in Don Quixote, with English Metrical Versions</marquage>. Southey thanked
          John Murray for a copy of Rodd’s 1812 collection in February 1812, noting that “[i]t will
          furnish a very amusing article” for the <marquage typemarq="italique">Quarterly
            </marquage>(<marquage typemarq="italique">CLRS</marquage> 2039). Among the eight ballads
          featuring Montesinos in the Rodd collections are “Count Grimwald and Montesinos,”
          “Montesinos and Oliveros,” and the four-part “Ancient Ballad of Montesinos &amp;c.,”
          featuring Durandarte and Belerma. Montesinos is also the focus of “Durandarte and
          Belerma,” translated by Matthew “Monk” Lewis, and included in his popular and
          controversial Gothic novel <marquage typemarq="italique">The Monk</marquage> (1796) as
          Matilda’s seduction song (Lewis 59-61). Tasked by his dying friend Durandarte to cut out
          his heart and deliver it to his “scornful” mistress Belerma, Montesinos ends the poem
          lamenting his own fate to live with his soul in the ground:</alinea>

        <alinea>The name Montesinos thus represents a compound literary allusion, to Cervantes and

        <alinea>But the name was also a watchword, revealing—to the initiated—further layers of
          historical knowledge and imaginative identification. Rickman’s remark on a “Spanish name
          (title)” being none the “worse for being understood by few” came in the context of his and
          Southey’s (ultimately abortive) plans for a second series of <marquage typemarq="italique">Colloquies </marquage>in 1830-1. The importance that both men gave to names is
          reflected in the fact that eight of the thirteen letters on the “New Colloquies” between
          January and mid-February 1831 contain discussions and reports of research on the subject.
          Candidates for Rickman’s name include: Manrique, Instantius, Vigilantius, Camarero,
          Cameraries, Severitus, Camaristo, Contador, Pesador, Cotejador, and—Rickman’s eventual
          choice, an allusion to his motto, “moderation is best”—Metretes (Huntington MSS RS561-574;
            <marquage typemarq="italique">RLL</marquage> 281). Southey’s letter to Rickman of
          February 3, 1831 reveals the amount of attention given to something he affected to treat
          as incidental: “I speak of you first as my host Manrique &amp; address you afterwards by
          the name of Camaristo—which may just as well be a surname in Spanish as Chamberlain is in
          English. It means a little too much, &amp; Camarero means something too little, this
          however is of no importance” (Huntington MS RS571; my transcription). Southey seems to
          have felt that this just gradation of meaning was already fully achieved in “Montesinos”:

        <alinea>There is not space in this essay to provide the full detail of Southey’s knowledge
          of and interest in each of these “Montesinos” figures. The detail may be found in Appendix
          B of the new Routledge edition of <marquage typemarq="italique">Colloquies</marquage> (see
            <marquage typemarq="italique">STM</marquage> 843-858). But it would be only a slight
          oversimplification to say that each of these “Montesinos” figures was the subject of a
          thumbnail biography by Southey—albeit of a progressively more oblique or “ghostly”
          character. Southey almost certainly provided the sources (if not the text) of the section
          on Antonio Montesino in his brother Thomas Southey’s <marquage typemarq="italique">Chronological History of the West Indies</marquage> (1827)—having probably been drawn
          to this figure by his similarity of his story to that of the Jesuit missionary in Brazil,
          Antonio Vieira (1608-1697), as recounted in the <marquage typemarq="italique">History of
            Brazil</marquage>, volume two (see <marquage typemarq="italique">STM</marquage>
          847-851). Southey also wrote the story of Fray Francisco—“the Provincial”—in his 1821
          publication (building on material a decade old from the <marquage typemarq="italique">Edinburgh Annual Register</marquage>), <marquage typemarq="italique">The Expedition of
            Orsua: And the Crimes of Aguirre</marquage>, where it occupies some ten or so pages of
          the text. For a significant portion of the narrative, this Montesinos is Aguirre’s only
          credible antagonist (see <marquage typemarq="italique">STM</marquage> 851-852). In 1807,
          Southey had provided brief biographical entries for John Aikin’s <marquage typemarq="italique">General Biography</marquage> on two figures closely associated in
          literary history with the Franciscan Fray Ambrosio de Montesinos: the precursor, Íñigo
          López de Mendoza (1398-1458), and the contemporary, D. Jorge Manrique (c.1440-1479).
          Southey subsequently suggested “Manrique” as a name for Rickman in the “New Colloquies”
          specifically because it would be in “Spanish”—and “litera[ry]”—“keeping” with “Montesinos”
          (see <marquage typemarq="italique">STM</marquage> 852-855). The ultra-utopian spirit of
          Antonio de Montezinos, meanwhile, is implicated in Southey’s comments in the <marquage typemarq="italique">History of Brazil</marquage>, volume three, about <marquage typemarq="italique">The Hope of</marquage>
          <marquage typemarq="italique">Israel</marquage> being “one of the most groundless
          treatises that ever was composed in the spirit of credulity” (<marquage typemarq="italique">STM</marquage> 855-856; and see <marquage typemarq="italique">HoB</marquage> III 722-723).</alinea>

        <alinea>So, Montesinos: religious poet, humanitarian lawmaker, “Provincial” opponent of
          colonial state-terrorism, and quasi-mythical utopian-cum-forger. This (un)familiar
          compound ghost, both intimate and unidentifiable, resonates with Southey’s own
          multi-layered historical identity, as Pantisocrat-turned-Poet-Laureate, “semi-Socinian”
          bulwark of the Anglican Establishment, and anti-Catholic Royal Spanish Academician
          historian of the Jesuits. Montesinos is Southey the modern English “entire man of letters”
          translated back onto a medieval Spanish palimpsest. The various identities of “Montesinos”
          may be taken together as a sort of “suspended reading,” in Stephen Greenblatt’s phrase
          (5), of Southey and his career. All four men named Montesinos are also John the Baptist
          figures, precursors eclipsed by more illustrious or notorious men: Antonio Montesino by
          Las Casas, Francisco Montesinos by Aguirre, Ambrosio Montesino by Ignatius Loyola, and
          Aharon Levi Montesinos by Ben Israel—and also by the <marquage typemarq="italique">earlier</marquage> figure of Thomas More.</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa26"><no>26</no>
        <alinea>This compound meaning of “Montesinos” as harbinger of the master is clearly
          suggestive for Southey’s sense of his own role in the literary triumvirate of the Lake
          Poets, or men of the mountains. As Tim Fulford has shown in the context of the <marquage typemarq="italique">Colloquies</marquage>, Southey in the later phase of his career
          effectively reinvented himself as a public spokesperson for Wordsworth and a “Lake Poet”
          ethos (Fulford 2013 29-68). The literal meaning of “Montesinos” as “man of the mountains”
          opens up further levels of possible allusion, however, and a potentially more subversive
          and conflicted sense of what such ideological projection might actually entail.</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa27"><no>27</no>
        <alinea>The name Montesinos—“which is,” the<marquage typemarq="italique"> Monthly
            Review</marquage> noted, “being interpreted, ‘Old Man of the Mountains’”—further encodes
          Southey’s reputation (discussed already at §9) as an extremist. “Methinks I want nothing
          but craziness to set up for a prophet,” Southey told Rickman on February 9, 1829
            (<marquage typemarq="italique">Selections</marquage> IV 128-129). In France in 1792-4,
          the “Montagnards,” seated in the highest benches of the National Assembly, were
          Robespierre’s party of regicide and terror. The name “Old Man of the Mountain” is also
          associated with the late-twelfth century Syrian figure Rashid Al-Din Sinan, and
          crusades-era myths of his “hashishim” or assassins carrying out political murders in
          return for paradise. Southey drew upon and dramatized this myth in Book VII of <marquage typemarq="italique">Thalaba </marquage>(1801), in which the Islamic hero destroys the
          false paradise of the sorcerer Aloadin. In <marquage typemarq="italique">Thalaba</marquage>, Southey supplies a lengthy note on this “old man named. Aloadin,”
          drawing on sources including Samuel Purchas, <marquage typemarq="italique">Purchas</marquage>
          <marquage typemarq="italique">his Pilgrimage </marquage>(1614), and the “undaunted liar
          Sir John Maundevile,” whose <marquage typemarq="italique">Voiage and Travaile
          </marquage>(London, 1727) describes the “Paradys” by a “Castelle […] in a mountayne” in
          “the Lond of Prestre John” (<marquage typemarq="italique">EPW </marquage>III 108-111,
          259-261). The episode in <marquage typemarq="italique">Thalaba</marquage> is closely
          associated with Coleridge’s “Kubla Khan” (pub. 1816), which closes on an inward
          transformation occurring somewhere between England, Abyssinia, and the Orient, on “Mount
          Abora,” “holy dread,” and “Paradise.” In <marquage typemarq="italique">The Book of the
            Church</marquage> (1824), Southey describes the fanatical and disciplined Jesuits as a
          tool in the hands of “[t]he Popes, at that time,” with young men of the right “temper”
          “ordered” to martyrdom in Japan, or doing the bidding of “their Old Man of the Mountain”
          by going to England to attempt the assassination of Elizabeth I, Queen of what “they
          called the European Japan” (II 276).</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa28"><no>28</no>
        <alinea>At the level of the work as a whole, these undercurrents in the name “Montesinos”
          may serve the dramatic purpose of subtly subverting his view, usually “upon the hopeful
          side” (<marquage typemarq="italique">STM </marquage>390); much as the recurrent echoes of
            <marquage typemarq="italique">Hamlet</marquage> work on the other side to call in
          question the “goodness” of Thomas More’s pessimistic Ghost. Southey’s allusive
          self-identification with Aloadin certainly reflects the preoccupation of <marquage typemarq="italique">Colloquies</marquage> as a whole with superstition, millenarianism,
          and with a “prospective” view of what Montesinos in Colloquy X calls the “renewed” social
          “danger”—linking the Reformation and the French Revolution—from “political insanity” and
          “religious fanaticism” (<marquage typemarq="italique">STM </marquage>190-191). “[T]he
          triumph of democratical fanaticism” in the French Revolution was, says Montesinos, the
          “counterpart of the Munster Tragedy, Marat and Hebert and Robespierre being the Johns of
          Leyden and the Knipperdollins of democracy” (<marquage typemarq="italique">STM</marquage>
          191). Britain is in imminent danger from this “plague,” Montesinos thinks—but the USA is
          next:</alinea>
        <bloccitation>
          <alinea>The government not thinking it necessary to provide religious instruction for the
            people in any of the new states, the prevalence of superstition, and that, perhaps, in
            some wild and terrible shape, may be looked for as one likely consequence of this great
            and portentous omission. An Old Man of the Mountain might find dupes and followers as
            readily as the All-friend Jemima; and the next Aaron Burr who seeks to carve a kingdom
            for himself out of the overgrown territories of the Union, may discover that fanaticism
            is the most effective weapon with which ambition can arm itself …</alinea>
          <source><marquage typemarq="italique">STM</marquage> 191</source>
        </bloccitation>
        <alinea>The allusions are to Jemima Wilkinson (1752-1819), the charismatic American
          evangelist and preacher of total sexual abstinence, and to Aaron Burr Jr. (1756-1836), the
          third Vice President of the USA, who became involved in a conspiracy to found a dynasty in
          Mexico after the duel that ended his career—and the life of Alexander Hamilton
          (1755/7-1804). These comments were later seen, in the words of pencil notes on a family
          copy of the <marquage typemarq="italique">Colloquies</marquage>, as not only properly
          historic—“+ Horace Walpole has a similar predication uttered in 1792”—but as strangely
          “prophetic”: “This has come to pass already”; “Mormonites” (<marquage typemarq="italique">STM</marquage> 623-244 n. 427, n. 428; see also item BL6B3 in the Boult collection at
          Bristol Reference Library). The words of Montesinos were indeed reprinted in 1843 as the
          epigraph to a book by Henry Caswall on <marquage typemarq="italique">The Prophet of the
            Nineteenth Century; or, the Rise, Progress, and Present State of the Mormons, or
            Latter-day Saints</marquage>. Echoing Southey’s “peculiar titles”—including his 1817
            <marquage typemarq="italique">Quarterly</marquage> essay on “The Rise and Progress of
          Popular Disaffection,” with its “devious” or “Coleridgean” implied reversal of
          “progressivist historical assumptions” (see Gilmartin, 238)—Caswall suggests a genuine
          power of prophecy in Southey’s book. Caswall’s preface “solicits” “[t]he reader’s
          attention” to:</alinea>
        <bloccitation>
          <alinea>a remarkable extract from Southey (inserted opposite the title page), which did
            not meet the Author’s eye until the greater part of this work was in print. The
            prediction was published in March, 1829, fourteen months previously to the publication
            [during the “pretended translation”] of the Book of Mormon ...</alinea>

        <alinea>In 1838, the Mormon “apostate” Thomas Marsh invoked the same “somewhat singular”
          passage in <marquage typemarq="italique">Colloquies</marquage> against its supposed
          prophetic subject, the Mormon founder Joseph Smith: “A prediction as early fulfilled as
          this was would have made Joseph a great Prophet” (Jeter §5). It was perhaps appropriate,
          however, that Marsh also misattributed the prophecy. It came from “Robert Southey, the
          Poet Laureate of England,” Marsh noted, and out of “the mouth of Sir Thomas More.” And
          thus once more Montesinos slips from self-identity, as reoriginating man of the
          mountains—and is gone.</alinea>

        <alinea>The “Romantic biographer” works with “archives, notebooks, letters,” but “similar”
          to the “new historicist” critic in most imaginative mood, s/he is attempting rightly to
          read textual absence: to feel at once the “human limits” of contexts, the circulating
          “energies of language,” and the invisible “shapes of imagination transmuting into poetry”
          (206-207). For Jerome McGann, to “maintai[n] the poem … in the artificially restricted
          geography of the individual person,” as traditional “biographical criticism” has tended to
          do, is to remain arrested at the level of “antiquarian humour” rather than history;
          “pleased,” in the words of the Wanderer in what Tom Clucas calls Wordsworth’s book of
          “parallel lives,” <marquage typemarq="italique">The Excursion</marquage> (1814), “To skim
          along the surfaces of things.” To read this way, for McGann, is to stumble upon “literary”
          truths of ever-increasing size, even as criticism “falters” and dwindles in the historical
          analysis (48-49). Roe, on the other hand—content to recognize that there is a viewer and a
          frame, and daring to hope that “articulate redress” may accrue to the artist framed within
          it—envisages the literary-biographical “stumble” as at least a faltering <marquage typemarq="italique">forward</marquage>. If the re-creative “inwardness” of such literary
          biography is “disquieting,” in Roe’s phrase, this may be because it is not really “deep”
          or “inward” at all. Returned from the bourne beyond “the artificially restricted geography
          of the individual,” such biography has instead become “ecological.” Or, to use the term
          that both Roe and Ann Wroe use to frame their new biographies of Shelley and Keats, it has
          become “elemental”: “This is biography as alchemy” (Roe 206-207).</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa30"><no>30</no>
        <alinea>Roe has in mind primarily the way that figures such as Keats and Hunt respond to the
          techniques of “Romantic Biography.” But he intimates that “[e]ven the Keswick <marquage typemarq="italique">renegado</marquage>, Robert Southey,” now “returned to print” (203),
          may also look different in this perspective. The self-multiplying author of <marquage typemarq="italique">Sir Thomas More</marquage> might, indeed, begin to seem a precursor
          of the “Romantic biographer.” Ernest Bernhardt-Kabisch’s <marquage typemarq="italique">Robert Southey</marquage> (1977) opens with a re-statement of the critical consensus
          about the laureate’s shortcomings as an autobiographical Romantic poet. Although he lived
          “in an age of great autobiography—and, indeed, seems to have coined the word,”</alinea>
        <bloccitation>
          <alinea>he left no distinct specimen of the genre. The fact is symptomatic: Southey was
            incapable of introspection. He could either recall reality in its surface minutiae or
            reduce it to poetic schemata of myth and allegory; but he could not alchemize personal
            fact into autonomous image and symbol.</alinea>
          <source>13</source>
        </bloccitation>
        <alinea>The criticism remains just. Southey was, as contemporaries charged, and this essay
          has further suggested, a writer of “minutiae” and “schemata” at once. But the complaint of
          a failure to “alchemize personal fact” misses what I have tried to suggest, and what Roe’s
          comments might help to imagine, is precisely the historical disclosure—the “biography as
          alchemy”—involved. The compression of meaning into a single word or name was, as I have
          argued, a key part of Southey’s “exoskeletal” or emblematic approach to complexity. The
          name “Montesinos” operates as a “hieroglyphic” sign or shape for the historical “question”
          of “character”—of what “corresponds” and what “distinguishes” in and between persons,
          cultures, and countries across time. And the way that this question is precisely confused
          in the critical moment of the ghost’s entrance—saying “Montesinos, a stranger from a
          distant country”—is perhaps the whole point. </alinea>
      </para><para id="pa31"><no>31</no>
        <alinea>The “Introduction” featuring this moment was substantially complete by early 1820
          (see <marquage typemarq="italique">CLRS</marquage> 3429). By the time the book was
          published and reviewed at the end of the decade, Southey seems to have lost sight of the
          ambiguity of his own language on the “stranger from a distant country,” and the
          uncertainty of the association between “Montesinos” and himself. He complained, as noted
          previously (see §3), about critics missing the allusion to <marquage typemarq="italique">Hamlet</marquage> and taking the phrase as an explanation of the foreign name,
          “Montesinos.” Nor was the misreading by the <marquage typemarq="italique">Literary
            Gazette</marquage> just a simple mistake. It represented a challenge to the boundaries
          between reading audiences, bypassing the watchword function of the “name … understood by
          few.” The <marquage typemarq="italique">Gazette</marquage> may indeed have revealed a lack
          of knowledge and of critical acumen as it reached to resolve the ambiguity too soon,
          imagining a second comma after “country,” and forcing upon the text the bizarre idea that
          the stranger who calls speaks first—and with his own name. But air-drawn signs and wrong
          first-speakers are, after all, also features straight from Shakespeare<marquage typemarq="italique">.</marquage> And what is true of “Utopia” and the widening meaning
          “understood by thousands” is no less true of <marquage typemarq="italique">Hamlet</marquage> or <marquage typemarq="italique">Macbeth</marquage>. The common
          “English” critic fitting “Montesinos” directly into the Shakespearean ambiance of “The
          Introduction” may thus have been reading better—or with a more “depthless” acuity—than
          Southey himself now knew or could wish. The “mistake” might be understood alternatively as
          a moment of historical parapraxis: a re-linking of the densely intertextual “sign” of
          “Montesinos”, with all its accumulated “counterfactual” heft—its power of “[g]hosting the
          ‘factual’” (Davies 11)—back to Southey’s own “eco-historical” vision of England in 1817.’
          “Montesinos” signifies utopian possibilities abroad. And at home, it whispers of absence
          and of what may yet rise—transplanted back “From America,” or from Portugal and
          Spain—within a “national” tradition accomplished, yet sparsely living; a susurration of
          the ghost soil.</alinea>

          eerie,” see Macfarlane, “The eeriness of the English countryside” (2015). “English eerie”
          combines “hauntology, geological sentience and political activism” to “explore the English
          landscape in terms of its anomalies rather than its continuities,” unearthing the
          terrifying “something” “seething” beneath the pastoral prospect. “Ghost soil” is a coinage
          of the William Morris disciple and #Hookland creator David Southwell, suggesting the
          repressed historical guilt as well as the re-enchantment and resistance that lurk in the
          countryside (<marquage typemarq="italique">Fortean Times</marquage>, 1 June
