Introduction Child maltreatment challenges the youth to successfully negotiate developmental tasks and cope with potentially chronic stress which makes substance use more attractive in terms of managing overwhelming tension, negative affective states, feelings of depersonalization, dissociation, and numbing, as well as a need to counter stress for normative socialization (e.g., MacMillan &amp; Munn, 2001; Wekerle, Miller, Wolfe, &amp; Spindel, 2006). Adolescence, in particular, is a  Abstract The social, cultural and political contexts of vulnerability need to be considered in defining, understanding, and reducing substance abuse among maltreated youth with an Aboriginal background (MacNeil, 2008; Tatz, 1999).

The concept of resilience is founded on the idea that poor outcomes do not  First Peoples Child &amp; Family Review, Volume 6, Number 1, 2011  Acknowledgements:  This paper developed from a conference (Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), Institute of Aboriginal Peoples Health funded) on service gaps (“Crossing the borders” see www.fncfcs.org) inspired by a preventable child’s life in hospital, never having lived at home in his reserve, due to federal-provincial lack of collaboration on care provision (see “Jordan’s Principle”).

Resilience is based on both fixed factors (i.e., race and gender) and context factors, such as the presence of positively engaged adult role models (Banyard et al., 2002; Siegel, 2000; Wekerle et al., 2007). Social learning theory advances that a youth learns by observing and interacting with adults, where continuity of interaction over time is expected to reinforce learned associations in social interactions, from engaging in conversation, to sharing attention or activities, to how to cope with stressors. Learning is enhanced when there are strong positive feelings towards the role model or a positive identification with them (e.g., Akers, Krohn, Lanza-Kaduce, &amp; Radosevich, 1979; Bandura, Adams, &amp; Beyer, 1977; Wall &amp; McKee, 2002). From social learning, “acceptable” norms and attitudes of behaviors as “good” (reinforcing) or “bad” (aversive or punishing) influences the degree to which an individual will be motivated to engage in the behaviors (Akers et al., 1979; 1992). Control theory (e.g., Hirschi, 1969) posits that the elements of bonding and attachment, commitment, involvement, and beliefs restrain antisocial tendencies, such as use of illicit drugs. Bonding to society initially occurs through attachment to parents or guardians, an empathic identification that fosters acceptance of their beliefs in the moral validity of societal laws. The most important of these elements are the beliefs that individuals have towards legal and illicit  substances, formed from adult role models and peers, which then inform values and actions from an individual to cultural level (Elliott, Huizinga, &amp; Ageton, 1985; Marcos, Bahr, &amp; Johnson, 1986). In the Aboriginal context, cultural safety reflects sensitivity to power imbalances and discrimination at many levels (National Aboriginal Health Organization, 2009). These are evident in Aboriginal families engaged in the child protective services (CPS) system, where Aboriginal children are over-represented, at over 10 times the rate of non-Aboriginal children, and where substantial resource inequity exists for family preservation (Auditor General of Canada, 2009; for a discussion of the historical mistreatment and child welfare issues, see Blackstock, 2009). For example, in Ontario, in 2006, about 16% of outof-home care were Aboriginal children, with 20% of reviewed Crown Wards (i.e., parental rights are terminated)1. Child protective services (CPS) youth represent a unique sub-population of adolescents in terms of studying resilience processes and factors. Most CPS youth will have a primary form of maltreatment substantiated (CIS-2003 report, Trocmé et al, 2005) and, according to self-report, many indicate more than one type of maltreatment (Trocmé et al, 2005). Also, as many youth reside in monitored environments, alcohol, which is the drug of choice for youth from a population perspective (e.g., OSDUHS report on 1. 37% of these Crown Wards were served by Aboriginal child welfare services. In terms of Aboriginal Crown Wards who were reviewed, 10% were placed in their home communities, and the majority had some involvement with cultural practices (e.g. Canadian Council on Learning (2009) Looking to the Futures Report, Wekerle et al, 2010)  ©©Randall Waechter, Eman Leung, Christine Wekerle, Marlyn Bennett, and The MAP Research Team  115  Cannabis Use Among Aboriginal Youth in the non-Aboriginal Child Protection Services System  trends over time, Adlaf et al, 2007), appears to be significantly under-used by CPS adolescents (i.e., Up against the wall report, Wekerle et al, 2009). From population studies, cannabis is the next most commonly used substance (e.g., Monitoring the Future Study, Johnston et al, 2009; OSDUHS report, Adlaf et al, 2007). Preliminary research with Canadian CPS youth indicate that problem or heavy cannabis use may be an area of risk, where females may be particularly vulnerable (Wekerle et al, 2009). While harm reduction approaches include a target of abstinence (Marlatt &amp; Witkiewitz, 2009; National Anti-Drug Strategy, 2009), understanding the contexts of resilience is important for prevention and early intervention. More recent evidence under-scores the toxicity of cannabis on the developing adolescent brain, including greater vulnerability to severe mental illness (Patton et al, 2002). Further, in health promotion terms, use of cannabis removes opportunities for other gainful engagement and use of funds. The physiological impact of cannabis is harmful to school performance, safe driving, etc. (e.g., driving while high, Adlaf et al, 2007; poor educational outcome, Fergusson &amp; Boden, 2008), although it reduces tension and may be sought as a means to cope with problems (e.g. cannabis is used as a means of self-medication for problems controlling aggression, Arendt et al, 2007). Recent reviews support the positive association between childhood maltreatment history and adolescent cannabis use (Tonmyr et al., in press). While research indicates that substance abuse is a community-identified problem, and Aboriginal youth show higher rates of cannabis use (e.g., Rutman et al., 2008), often the contribution of poverty and social service resources are not considered (MacMillan et al., 1996). Presently, CPS services do not routinely screen youth on their substance use, and adolescent-specific substance abuse treatment availability is low (e.g., Wekerle et al, 2009). Aboriginal cultures tend to incorporate an ideology of collectivism, as demonstrated in research on the significant role of shared childrearing responsibilities among families and  116  communities (e.g., Dilworth-Anderson &amp; Marshall, 1996). In this culture, children may be raised in an open-system, extended-family context where there may be multiple important caregivers (Red Horse, 1982). As such, Aboriginal children may be more accepting of multiple caring adult guardians (Christensen &amp; Manson, 2001). Beebe et al. (2008) report that non-parental adult role models were associated with four to seven-fold lower odds of alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use among American Indian (AI) adolescents. Swaim et al. (1993) report that “Peer drug associations, although still dominant in the model, were not as highly correlated with drug use for American Indian youths (when compared to Anglo youths), and family sanctions against drugs had a direct influence on drug use in addition to an indirect influence (among American Indian youth)” (p. 53). As a result of the migration away from traditional ways of life, of the 4.1 million persons who reported American Indian/Alaska Native (AI/AN) race on the 2000 U.S. Census, 67% (2.8 million) resided in urban areas (US Census, 2000). Youth also make up a large proportion of the total AI/AN population, with one-third under age 18, compared to less than one-quarter of the white population (US Census Native Summary File, 2000). Almost 1 million people self-identify as Aboriginal in Canada, representing 3.3% of the total population. While many live on reserves, 41% reside in non-reserve areas (36% urban, 5% rural) (Kirmayer, Simpson, &amp; Cargo, 2003). The population is demographically distinctive in being younger than the general Canadian population (mean age 25.5 vs. 35.4 for general population), with fully one-third of the Aboriginal population is younger than 15 years of age (Kirmayer, Simpson, &amp; Cargo, 2003). As such, it is important to consider Aboriginal youth living off of reserves (i.e., in urban areas). In this paper, we report on the Maltreatment and Adolescent Pathways (MAP) Longitudinal Study which collects data from randomlyselected active case files in three CPS agencies that together capture most of the CPS “traffic” in a large Canadian urban centre. Here, we  First Peoples Child &amp; Family Review, Volume 6, Number 1, 2011, pp. 114-125  First Peoples Child &amp; Family Review, Volume 6, Number 1, 2011  present an exploratory comparison of Aboriginal youth in the non-Aboriginal CPS system to nonAboriginal youth in the same system on cannabis use. While Aboriginal CPS agencies are provided in this geographical region, some youth may not find themselves in this system. We hypothesize that Aboriginal youth have greater flexibility in connecting with caring adult guardians given their cultural context of resilience in community concepts of “family” and may be more likely to benefit from this extended circle of adult caregivers than non-Aboriginal youth. For youth who are wards of the state, the caseworker represents an adult who is potentially involved with the youth over the long-term and is mandated by law to visit with the youth every 90 days in the jurisdiction of the present study. It is specifically predicted that Aboriginal youth who report a positive identification with their caseworker will report less cannabis use than Aboriginal youth or non-Aboriginal youth who report a negative relationship with their caseworker. For purposes of this study, Aboriginal background is considered broadly in terms of the youths’ identification, rather than a status Indian designation.  Method The MAP study followed a community-university collaboration model (Waechter et al., 2009) and received ethics clearance from CPS agencies and university research ethics boards. CPS youth who participated in the MAP Study were drawn via random numbers table from CPS agency provided master lists of all active caseloads of youth aged 14.0 to 17.0. This age range was selected to maximize the measurement of adolescent health risk behaviors, such as substance use. The three participating CPS agencies account for the majority of the child welfare caseloads in this urban centre. (For further details on the MAP study, see Wekerle et al., 2009 and Waechter et al., 2009). The sampled targeting youth who were in care and living with their biological families,  where cases of the latter type could be opened for a short time frame (i.e., less than 6 months)2. Thus, of 1879 cases sampled, 56% were available for study inclusion, with the majority issue being that the case was already closed by the time of readiness of caseworkers to contact youth about a research opportunity. Other reasons for ineligibility at the CPS agency checking-stage included youth being outside the 14.0 to 17.0 year age range (4%), youth developmental delay (12%), youth being absent without leave (7%), and the youth being in a crisis (i.e., actively suicidal, self-harming, in extended treatment or detention – 9%). Of the 827 eligible youth who remained at the time of writing, 259 refused participation and 560 had participated in the initial testing point for a 68% recruitment rate, and 1% were in the process of initial data collection (Eight youth still need to be contacted about initial involvement in the study). MAP participants did not differ significantly from non-participants with respect to youth age, gender or type of maltreatment. However, there is a significant contingency between participation in the current project and youth CPS status (X2 (1, N = 560) = 112.02, p  .05)  at or higher than the median on the CPS worker identification scale was not statistically significant (see Table 2). A test of the Homogeneity of the Odds Ratios between the two contingency tables (ie., low identification with CPS worker versus medium-high identification with CPS worker) was significant (Breslow-Day Chi-Square=4.52, p&lt;.05). These results suggest that the statistically significant association between Aboriginal youth and cannabis consumption is more frequent among those who are low in identification with their CPS worker than those who are not.  122  Discussion The results partially support our hypothesis. Aboriginal youth who report a medium-high (i.e., positive) identification with their CAS caseworker reported less cannabis use during the past 12 months than Aboriginal youth who reported a more negative (i.e., low) identification with their CAS caseworker. However, cannabis use was not lower among Aboriginal youth compared to nonAboriginal youth overall, as was hypothesized. Instead, the significant difference in cannabis  First Peoples Child &amp; Family Review, Volume 6, Number 1, 2011, pp. 114-125  First Peoples Child &amp; Family Review, Volume 6, Number 1, 2011  use among Aboriginal youth is driven by a much higher likelihood of use over the past 12 months among those who report a low identification with their CAS caseworker. As such, poor caseworker identification my present as a significant risk factor for these youth. More generally, these results suggest that caseworker identification may be an important variable for understanding Aboriginal youth outcomes in the child protection services system. This study allowed youth to endorse multiple ethnicities and, thereby, approach Aboriginal identity more broadly than categorically. This study did not address the extent to which youth engaged in Aboriginal practices, were connected to Aboriginal Friendship or community centres, or maintained contact with Aboriginal siblings, families, and heritage community. Further, the study did not assess the ethnicity of caseworkers and the match of youth ethnicity to caseworker ethnicity is unknown. Given that most of these youth have been involved with CPS over a number of years, it may be important to consider caseworkers as potential attachment figures and a moderate-to-high positive identification with caseworkers may be a protective factor, at least with respect to engaging in cannabis use, as compared to youth who report low levels of positive identification with their caseworker. Identification with caseworker is not typically formally assessed by youth within CPS and the current 7-item scale may be useful in this regard. In general, research with maltreated youth considering substance use has not considered empirically youth perceptions of aspects of their relationship with their caseworker. In this study, most caseworkers were the legal guardians in whole, or in part, for most of these youth. These preliminary results suggest that identification with caseworker may be a fruitful area to pursue in further research on adolescent adjustment among those that are involved with the child welfare system and, given the context of Aboriginal youth in non-Aboriginal child welfare agencies, may be salient in considering Aboriginal youth outcomes.  Finally, it is important to consider that these results may not generalize to Aboriginal youth within an Aboriginal child welfare agency, or nonurban Aboriginal youth, or youth solely identifying themselves as having an Aboriginal background.
