This is true especially in Canada,          a country where collective identities seem disparate and fragmented within the ostensible          multicultural “mosaic”: from coast to coast, cultural and ethnic backgrounds vary, as do          religious practices and social norms. Canadians of all backgrounds nevertheless find ways          to communicate and share their foodways, regardless of language. The language of food          might actually be a more apt <marquage typemarq="italique">lingua franca</marquage> than          English or French. Food not only shapes identities, but it can also act as a pivot or          bridge language between divergent identities, a form of cultural mediation or translation. </alinea></para><para id="pa2"><no>2</no><alinea>Massimo Montanari, whose research informs many of the articles in this issue, explains that: </alinea><bloccitation><alinea> On all social levels sharing a table is the first sign of membership in a group.            That might be the family but also a broader community – each brotherhood, guild, or            association reasserts its own collective identity at the table. [...] Eating together            does not necessarily mean all is love and harmony. If the table is the metaphor for            life, it represents in a direct and exacting way both membership in a group and the            relationships defined within that group.<renvoi id="re1no1" idref="no1" typeref="note">1</renvoi></alinea></bloccitation></para><para id="pa3"><no>3</no><alinea>If shared foodways are integral to the forging of collective identities within groups, food          trade can act as a bridge for communication between groups. In “Les Québécois francophones          et leur ‘identité’ alimentaire,” Yvon Desloges alludes to such a notion of cultural          contact. Desloges asserts that Québécois food identities are the result of cross-cultural          contact between four main groups in the 19<exposant>th</exposant> century: the First          Nations, the French, the British, and the American. From a semiotics perspective,          moreover, both food and language function as “codes of communication.” They: </alinea><bloccitation><alinea>convey symbolic and <marquage typemarq="italique">signifying</marquage> meanings            of widely differing kinds (economic, social, political, religious, ethnic, aesthetic),            both inside and outside the societies that express them [and also convey] the culture of            [their] practitioner[s]; [these codes are] the repositor[ies] of traditions and of            collective identity.<renvoi id="re1no2" idref="no2" typeref="note">2</renvoi></alinea></bloccitation></para><para id="pa4"><no>4</no><alinea>Food may be a language in a Montanarian sense, with its own “grammar,”<renvoi id="re1no3" idref="no3" typeref="note">3</renvoi> but as this issue demonstrates, it is also a visual, aesthetic, and sensory          language. In “Food, Photographs, and Frames,” Sonya Sharma and Gwen Chapman analyze the          visual language of photo elicitation as a means of cracking these food codes. Food          photography illustrates an essential dialectic, from how relationships with food can shape          identity to how perceived ontological narratives can shape relationships with food. As an          aesthetic language, food also has performative potential, whether it lies in preparation,          presentation, or description. Such performances may be elaborately embellished, as Renée          Desjardins observes of the discourse of menus at Château Frontenac in Quebec City, or they          may be relatively mundane yet semantically loaded, as Holly Everett notes of the discourse          surrounding mealtimes at two bed and breakfast inns (B&amp;Bs) in Newfoundland and          Labrador. As a sensory language, the tastes, smells, and even sounds of food—the sizzling          of fat in a pan, the popping of popcorn, the slurping of soup—can speak to and create food          identities.</alinea></para><para id="pa5"><no>5</no><alinea>The language of food<marquage typemarq="italique">, </marquage>as well as the language          describing food, also enables the rebuttal and transgression of certain cultural          stereotypes. Although Quebec is proud of having developed a distinctive cuisine drawing          from regionally sourced ingredients, for instance, the eclectic and cosmopolitan food          scenes in Montreal and Quebec City attest to a real Québécois fondness for fusion cuisine.          In Quebec, in fact, fusion cuisine goes back decades: Desjardins reveals archived menus          from the Château Frontenac indicating that while local and <marquage typemarq="italique">terroir</marquage> ingredients were key menu staples, British, French and other European          cuisines had made their way into the Québécois professional kitchen by the early          20<exposant>th</exposant> century, long before fusion was <marquage typemarq="italique">le          goût du jour</marquage>. Similarly, in “Newfoundland and Labrador on a Plate,” Everett          illustrates that a shared meal at a Newfoundland B&amp;B offers a space for local          residents to show tourists that the “Newfie” stereotype is just that—a stereotype. As          Diane Tye demonstrates in “Lobster Tales,” even assumptions about certain food items are          up for debate. Many visitors to Atlantic Canada perceive lobster as a “luxury meal” or a          “special event” ingredient, while elite chefs have even used this coveted seafood to up          the ante of the humble poutine: lobster poutine now appears on the menu of quite a few          high-end restaurants.<renvoi id="re1no4" idref="no4" typeref="note">4</renvoi> As Tye explains, however, tourists          who seek out lobster in Maritime Canada may find themselves faced with an entirely          different narrative: lobster as subsistence food. Whereas for tourists the word “lobster”          connotes luxury, for Maritime locals it may represent an entirely different identity          marker, associated with poverty, humility, and even shame.</alinea></para><para id="pa6"><no>6</no><alinea>The variety of theoretical perspectives, methodologies, and food-related corpora appearing in this thematic issue testifies to the wealth and complexity of relationships between food, identity, and language. Canada offers an extremely rich cultural space in which to study these relationships, precisely because its demographical makeup is so varied and because identity, particularly cultural identity, is at the heart of much discussion about what it means to be Canadian in an increasingly heterogeneous social space. We hope that this selection of research and creative work will inspire readers to consider how they forge their own “culinary identities” or relationships with food practices. </alinea></para><para id="pa7"><no>7</no><alinea>As editors of this special thematic issue, however, and as Translation Studies scholars          whose research is necessarily shaped by the Canadian context and by our own Canadian          culinary identities, we are also fascinated by the points at which Food and Translation          Studies intersect. In introducing this issue on <marquage typemarq="italique">Food,          Language, and Identity</marquage>, we would therefore like to suggest a few places where          the circulation of concepts between these emerging disciplines might prove useful for          further investigation and collaboration.</alinea></para><para id="pa8"><no>8</no><alinea>One such intersection is the topic of food and cultural transmission. Felipe Fernández-Armesto argues that “[t]here is no more intriguing problem in the history of food than that of how cultural barriers to the transmission of foods and foodways have been traversed or broken.”<renvoi id="re1no5" idref="no5" typeref="note">5</renvoi> To this, we would be tempted to add that there is no more intriguing problem in the history of food than that of how its displacement—or better yet, its<marquage typemarq="italique"> translation</marquage>—has taken place. Terms chosen by Fernández-Armesto to qualify his history of food, “traversed” and “broken,” acknowledge the intrinsic violence of this movement, this displacement, this translation.</alinea></para><para id="pa9"><no>9</no><alinea>Familiarity and resistance are defining concepts in both Food Studies and Translation Studies. In Translation Studies, this dialectic manifests itself in the domestication or naturalization of a source text; translators may attempt to reassure the target audience by presenting the reader with a foreign text in a linguistic form they recognize. In Food Studies, this is reflected in the development of regional and national foodways. As Fernández-Armesto writes: “[e]ven with the world’s markets at their command, most people restrict their usual menus and demand the same dishes over and over again… Eaters’ bias in favour of the familiar affects entire cultures.”<renvoi id="re1no6" idref="no6" typeref="note">6</renvoi> The same is true for linguistic and cultural arenas. For one to resort to that which is “familiar”<renvoi id="re1no7" idref="no7" typeref="note">7</renvoi> in lieu of feeling dispossessed before something unrecognizable recalls the very function of translation, and is guided by many of the same rules that have guided the episteme of translation throughout its history. Despite its powerful attractions, the “foreign” must be subjected to the test of familiarity in both kitchen and library; it must be translated. </alinea></para><para id="pa10"><no>10</no><alinea>As Charlene Elliott argues, “control over food representations has powerful implications for perceptions of one’s own and other cultures.”<renvoi id="re1no8" idref="no8" typeref="note">8</renvoi> In “Consuming the Other: Packaged Representations of Foreignness in <marquage typemarq="italique">President's Choice</marquage>,” Elliott writes that: </alinea><bloccitation><alinea> Food packaging provides a rich text for analysis, for its surface and its            contents are consumed: food “messages” are digested both figuratively and literally.            Anthropologists have long established food’s role in creating identity and status,            establishing taste and defining cultural otherness.<renvoi id="re1no9" idref="no9" typeref="note">9</renvoi></alinea></bloccitation></para><para id="pa11"><no>11</no><alinea>Food packaging, especially when it portrays its contents as “exotic” or “foreign,” is          ultimately about the concept of consuming the Other. When an unfamiliar food is “tasted”          or “consumed to reveal one’s mastery over it” rather than “embraced” or “consumed to          reveal one’s self-identification with it,” the source culture is Othered, “reduced down to          a series of stock props.”<renvoi id="re1no10" idref="no10" typeref="note">10</renvoi> “These props or cultural          signifiers present stereotypical perceptions of the Other to the Western gaze,”<renvoi id="re1no11" idref="no11" typeref="note">11</renvoi> or rather, in the case of Loblaws’ “exotic” <marquage typemarq="italique">President’s Choice</marquage> brand products, the Canadian gaze.          Elliott describes the symbolic power of such a perspective:</alinea><bloccitation><alinea> Representations of the Other through food and its packaging have great symbolic            potency, and this ‘labeling’ of foreignness proves significant precisely because it            seems so innocuous. But the seemingly harmless marketing of foodstuffs is really a form            of power—power operating over both representation and taste.<renvoi id="re1no12" idref="no12" typeref="note">12</renvoi></alinea></bloccitation></para><para id="pa12"><no>12</no><alinea>In much the same way, translated Food Studies texts offer a privileged locus for observing the re-presentation of food-related issues by way of a foreign language. Because translation claims to talk <marquage typemarq="italique">about</marquage> source culture but <marquage typemarq="italique">on behalf of</marquage> target culture, it can operate in very subtle ways. If one is going to study relationships between food and language in the western hemisphere, moreover, then French and English are an obvious starting point—especially for Canadian Food and Translation Studies scholars, since French and English are our two main working languages. We are grateful for this opportunity to foreground language and translation and the critical role they continue to play in the development of Canadian culinary identities.</alinea></para></section1></corps><partiesann lang="en"><grnotebio><notebio id="nb1" idrefs="au1" lang="en"><nompers><prenom>Marc</prenom><nomfamille>Charron</nomfamille></nompers><alinea>Marc Charron is Associate Professor at the School of Translation and Interpretation of the University of Ottawa.
