        <alinea>Research in cross-cultural management usually postulates that mutual expectations
          must be clearly assessed and consequently claims that it is necessary to efficiently
          communicate in order to understand each other, this understanding being a prerequisite for
          efficient collective action. Hence, if we look at a successful multicultural organization,
          we should find - following the dominant literature in both Cross Cultural Management
          (CCM<renvoi id="re1no1" idref="no1" typeref="note">1</renvoi>) and communication - clear mutual understanding. We
          focused on a case of a <marquage typemarq="italique">happy</marquage> cross-cultural
          encounter, where actors work in a successful company that is performing well in its market
          and is financially prosperous. The business skills of some are coupled by the creativity
          of others hence leading to a balanced and satisfactory situation claimed by all<renvoi id="re1no2" idref="no2" typeref="note">2</renvoi> and confirmed by economic results<renvoi id="re1no3" idref="no3" typeref="note">3</renvoi>. This case is considered to be a salient empirical support to question mutual
          understanding. The central research question is therefore quite simple: <marquage typemarq="italique">does a happy cultural cooperation necessarily mean that actors share a
          mutual understanding?</marquage> In other words, <marquage typemarq="italique">to what
          extent</marquage> <marquage typemarq="italique">do</marquage> <marquage typemarq="italique">multicultural people involved in successful cooperation understand
          each other?</marquage></alinea>
      </para><para id="pa2"><no>2</no>
        <alinea>Thinking that mutual understanding is shared while it is not the case is not new for
          research in other disciplines such as communication or socio-linguistics. Still, what we
          propose to do here is to cross these approaches with CCM research since theories from the
          field usually explain that misunderstandings lead to inefficiency. In the literature,
          cases of successfully managed multiculturalism say that organizations manage to overcome
          cultural differences either thanks to local reinterpretations of management practices that
          take indigenous frameworks of meaning into consideration, or to clever organizational
          strategy. For example, in Barmeyer’s case study<renvoi id="re1no4" idref="no4" typeref="note">4</renvoi>, a
          well-balanced power relation between the French and the Germans enables the company to
          perform well. We make it clear that the object of the present article is not to wonder why
          things work. Rather we wish to demonstrate how far, in this given case, actors from
          different cultural groups are ignorant of the divergent interpretations they respectively
          give to a similar situation, and how illusive mutual understanding might be enough to
          efficiently coordinate operations in a cross-cultural environment.</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa3"><no>3</no>
        <alinea>This article is organized as follows: Firstly, we present a literature review on
          cross-cultural management, intercultural communication and language studies, three fields
          focusing mainly on understanding human interactions and communication efficiency, either
          from a cultural or a linguistic perspective. Secondly, we describe a qualitative case
          study, presenting the context as well as the methods regarding data collection and data
          analysis. The main findings of our empirical work are then presented. We will see that
          identical language can in reality refer to very distinct meanings. The article ends with a
          discussion of the results, presents some limitations and recommendations and eventually a
          conclusion that formulates two contributions to the field. First, this article contributes
          to providing practical insight to enhance cross-cultural cooperation by arguing that
          successful management in a cross-cultural environment does not necessarily involve
          cross-cultural understanding: cross-cultural managerial success lies upon compatible
          positive understandings of a similar situation rather than upon similar visions, hence
          developing the notion of harmless - sometimes even<marquage typemarq="italique">
          productive – misunderstandings</marquage>, this latter term rather being called “<marquage typemarq="italique">divergent-understandings”</marquage>. Secondly, it also aims to
          enhance the understanding of cross-cultural interactions. It claims that in multicultural
          contexts, whatever the organizational and operational efficiency, linguistic similarities
          coupled by what are assumed identical identities cannot be taken as a proof of mutual
          understanding. Differences in understandings may exist without the actors realizing it.
          Simultaneously, these differences are not necessarily synonymous with failure; rather they
          can generate fruitful international collaboration. The goal is not to encourage the
          dismissal of cross-cultural awareness among multicultural team members, but rather to
          incite managers to be wise, curious, and creative.</alinea>

        <alinea>Daily business life offers many examples of more or less problematic cross-cultural
          cooperation. Research in CCM usually refers to dominant theories that stipulate that
          cultural diversity within companies is sometimes considered as a source of richness – if
          well-managed (Chevrier, 2008, 2011a, 2011b; Chevrier &amp; Segal, 2011; Barmeyer &amp;
          Mayrhofer, 2002), but more generally, it usually generates difficulties, weak performance,
          misunderstandings, not to mention cultural frictions (Shenkar, 2012; Shenkar, Luo &amp;
          Yeheskel, 2008) or conflicts (Shenkar &amp; Zeira, 1992; Sarangi, 1994). Until recently,
          <marquage typemarq="italique">“the usual way of dealing with those cultural differences is
          precisely to ignore them and to leave actors manage with them“ </marquage>(Chevrier,
          2008). Today, things are changing and a great number of companies not only rely uniquely
          upon the innate ability of individuals to adapt to situations and upon their tolerance for
          uncomfortable situations. As regards to cross-cultural management, the dominant thought
          claims that cultural diversity must be taken into account (Chanlat, Davel &amp; Dupuis,
          2013). One particular approach, developed by Philippe d’Iribarne, insists that it must be
          done considering culture as a logic that generates a specific framework of meaning which
          provides an interpretation grid to individuals that enables them to give sense to others’
          actions as well as their own (d’Iribarne, 1989, 2008; d’Iribarne &amp; al, 1998).
          D’Iribarne’s research, based on an anthropological definition of culture (Geertz, 1973),
          shows the embeddedness of those cultural logics, deeply-rooted in people’s mindsets and
          that remain stable over time. Cultural logic may, however, appear under different guises
          and be embodied differently throughout time. Other scholars establish a supposed logical
          link between understanding the other and efficient cooperation (Kostova, 2010; Brannen
          &amp; Salk, 2000; Søderberg &amp; Holden, 2002). In all cases, tolerance is prescribed.
          The question here is to better understand the <marquage typemarq="italique">“other”</marquage> in order to reduce conflicts and potential misunderstandings whilst
          simultaneously enhancing cooperation. Intercultural business communication and
          sociolinguistics also study how to understand the other to improve interaction. They
          mainly consider interaction processes through linguistic aspects. A deep concern is
          dedicated to possible misunderstandings, thus validating the need <marquage typemarq="italique">“to detect possible cultural interferences…to avoid
          misunderstandings”</marquage> (Gumperz, 2003). The blame is often placed on language,
          hence the need to master the fluency of at least the international reference language –
          namely English (usually English as a Lingua Franca, ELF<renvoi id="re1no5" idref="no5" typeref="note">5</renvoi>)
          – which has been scrutinized by educational systems as well as practitioners. Some
          scholars show that cross-language communication requires specific skills and attitudes
          (Holden, 2002) and that the ability to use a specific language system is not enough to
          evaluate communication and interactional skills (Marschan-Piekkari &amp; Charles, 2002).
          Other studies highlight the need to include interactionist aspects (Fracchiolla, 2009), as
          well as contextual ones (Gallois &amp;<marquage typemarq="italique"> al</marquage>, 1988).
          The core concern is clearly to try to decode the situation in such a way that actors will
          adapt the corresponding attitude, language and strategy. When the literature mentions
          possible differences in meaning-attribution the main focus remains on the potential harm
          generated by conflictual meanings such as the dangers of ELF (Tréguer-Felten, 2009, 2013).
          Very few authors deal with the potential harmless effect on the communication process
          (Louÿs &amp; Sauvage, 2014). Yet, in our case, the interviewees claim to understand each
          other, declare a similarity in identity and in practices, and do not mention any
          linguistic difficulties. Therefore, the research design has been drawn on open exploration
          of reasons that may account for the observed unexpected success of multicultural
          cooperation. </alinea>

        <alinea>Since our counterintuitive research question, “<marquage typemarq="italique">Does a
          happy cultural cooperation necessarily mean that actors share a mutual
          understanding?”</marquage> - extended to: “<marquage typemarq="italique">To what extent do
          people from different cultural background involved in a successful multicultural
          cooperation mutually understand each other?” -</marquage> had more to do with analyzing
          than understanding, we found it relevant to base this research on a qualitative approach,
          and more specifically an interpretive one. In fact, the deep analysis of the underlying
          meanings of some selected words, made with a cultural comparison perspective, led us to
          favor d’Iribarne’s ethnographical case study approach (1989, 1996, and 2011). The
          qualitative empirical research has then been carried out as an exemplary case study (Yin,
          2003), from which a theoretical hypothesis can be illustrated and developed (Eisenhardt,
          1989). Following d’Iribarne’s theory on the traces left by culture and his associated
          method to unveil them, we used the verbatim transcriptions to study a series of “clues”
          about the meanings associated to a given word or notion. We took an in-depth look at the
          references implicitly referred to by interviewees when using a word. This means that
          beyond and besides an apparent meaning attached to a word, we compared the categories
          mobilized when using this very word: to what image or notion they were associating it with
          or linking it to, what they actually meant and what sorts of description they were making
          of their definition and conception of this very word. By doing so, we could draw a sort of
          stable reference system of meaning, studying the links people establish between a notion
          and the references they associated to it. This is known as the <marquage typemarq="italique">“chain of significance”</marquage>.</alinea>

          based close to Miami. Created in 1991, it is of Peruvian origin (it was originally a
          business unit of a Peruvian company and was then outsourced through the acquisition of a
          fragrance factory). Of average size (around 100 employees in 2008, 50 in the offices, 50
          at the production factory), <marquage typemarq="italique">GoodScent</marquage> creates,
          develops and sells essence oils and fragrance components for the perfume &amp; fragrance
          industry. The market concerned is the Northern American market. This successful company’s
          turnover raised US$ 49, 2 million for 2012, displaying astonishing business growth (see
          Figures 1 &amp; 2 <marquage typemarq="italique">infra</marquage>).</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa7"><no>7</no>
        <alinea>As far as the social dynamics are concerned, the company presents a case of
          particularly dense cultural diversity. Besides three French perfumers, it has more than
          twenty different nationalities among which a great majority is Latino-American - 90% of
          the employees, from management to staff, one third from Columbia, one third from Peru, the
          remaining third being composed of varied Latino-American persons – from Costa-Rica,
          Venezuela, Ecuador and Brazil. Not a single American, neither in terms of nationality nor
          of origin, in its ranks. The remaining 10% includes one person from Belgium and two from
          Switzerland. The organizational pattern shows a very specific functional distribution (see
          Figure 3 <marquage typemarq="italique">infra</marquage>): all of the three perfumers
          constitute the top management (one of them being the Chief Executive Officer - CEO<renvoi id="re1no7" idref="no7" typeref="note">7</renvoi>), and each of the strategic functions such as Marketing, Sales,
          Communication and Product Development are led by Latino-Americans.</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa8"><no>8</no>
        <alinea>The working languages are English and Spanish. The three French mainly use English
          as a daily working idiom and speak only in French when speaking with one another. Some of
          them speak a little bit of Spanish with some Latino-Americans. The managerial philosophy –
          as explained by the CEO - relies on <marquage typemarq="italique">“personal
          autonomy”</marquage>, <marquage typemarq="italique">“on the individual’s awareness about
          knowing what has to be done and how – [I] let everybody completely free”, </marquage>and
          eventually<marquage typemarq="italique"> “on a duty the company has towards its people to
          increase their competences and to give back to them”</marquage>. Intercultural
          understanding problems coupled with those of classical management could have caused a deep
          obstacle to cooperation, but the situation is nothing like that: business results have
          been done well for twenty years<renvoi id="re1no8" idref="no8" typeref="note">8</renvoi> and the social internal
          balance also seems to be particularly satisfying, with less than 1% in staff turnover per
          year. Of course, as mentioned previously, good results should not only be attributed to
          the satisfying relational managerial interactions<renvoi id="re1no9" idref="no9" typeref="note">9</renvoi>. For
          example, we could add the <marquage typemarq="italique">French Touch</marquage> dimension
          that is highly valued in the perfume industry and which grants <marquage typemarq="italique">GoodScent</marquage> French perfumers with a welcome professional
          legitimacy. Furthermore, everybody declares their satisfaction of working there, and
          celebrates an <marquage typemarq="italique">“unusual and exceptional”</marquage>
          atmosphere, as almost all the respondents told us (<marquage typemarq="italique">“aquí

        <alinea>We will only focus on the managerial and interactional perspective, since all the
          actors claim that they are efficient thanks to a clearly identified mutual understanding.
          We purposefully chose a successful situation, where neither classical cross-cultural
          issues nor ones linked to multilingualism were mentioned, and where actors collectively
          declared their satisfaction. This situation that can be considered free-from disturbance
          allowed the research to exclusively focus on interactionist issues and analyses of
          sense-making processes.</alinea>

        <alinea>In line with established qualitative research protocol, we chose to focus on
          purposeful sampling (Patton, 1990). The field research was conducted between June 2007 and
          August 2008 in the Miami area, both at the offices (26 interviews) and at the production
          factory (4 interviews). The corpus is thus composed of 30 semi-directed interviews that
          were led with the three French senior managers/perfumers-creators (including the CEO),
          with Latino-American managers (Marketing - Sales Development – Strategy - Product
          Development – R&amp;D) and finally Latino-American workers from the offices and from the
          plant (see Tables 2<marquage typemarq="petitecap">a</marquage> and 2<marquage typemarq="petitecap">b</marquage> <marquage typemarq="italique">infra</marquage> for
          details). All of these interviews were recorded and supplemented with field notes and
          participant observation carried out on several occasions during meetings or informal talks
          throughout the same period of time (Patton, 1990; Yin, 2003). Likewise, the interviews
          were transcribed verbatim and kept in their original language (no translation was
          processed)<renvoi id="re1no11" idref="no11" typeref="note">11</renvoi>.</alinea>

        <alinea>The interviews were conducted either through company or factory visits and lasted
          between 45 minutes to one hour and a half. All of them were recorded using a protocol of
          open-ended questions. The language used was left to the choice of the participants in
          order to preserve the original language and to avoid – or reduce - linguistic problems, in
          particular those generated by ELF (Treguer-Felten, 2009, 2013). Still, it is interesting
          to notice that not all the Latino-Americans chose Spanish, although it was their native
          language, as Figure<marquage typemarq="petitecap"> 4</marquage> shows: 60% chose to
          express themselves in Spanish, 30% in English. A closer look made us observe that those in
          charge of strategic functions all made the choice of English, operational staff tending to
          choose Spanish. During data collection, the multilingual ability of the researcher emerged
          as a facilitating factor, giving the possibility for interviewees to switch from one
          language to another when needed, depending on the linguistic skills of each respondent,
          namely the level of fluency, the scope of his/her lexical knowledge, or whenever they were
          hesitant to use such or such a word in a given language (Spanish or English) and opted for
          the other language (this concept is described in literature as <marquage typemarq="italique">“code-switching”</marquage>). Language never emerged from the
          interviews as a barrier to internal-communication flows; the possible reasons for this
          apparent ease in daily communication are multiple, such as the corporate structure itself
          and its national origin, its geographical location, the number of nationalities involved
          and the daily use of several languages and the interplay of various languages according to
          the different cultural interactions. Subsequent analyses of the case narratives revealed
          that for the Latino-American sample the corresponding meanings remained unchanged whatever
          the language they were using.</alinea>

        <alinea>Mutual understanding, we were told by the company’s members, was based on commonly
          shared concepts and values and voiced the same way with similar words. In a nutshell,
          actors were claiming that in <marquage typemarq="italique">GoodScent</marquage>,
          relationships between people from different cultural backgrounds were easy thanks to clear
          communication due to shared visions of things, common vocabulary and practices. As a
          consequence, they were communicating well with an apparent absence of need to really
          explain things, as if the obviousness of this proximity was preventing them from needing
          (and thus wanting) to be more explicit about underlying meanings. Nearly all the
          participants used words or expressions (in their chosen respective language) such as
          <marquage typemarq="italique">“we are alike”</marquage>, <marquage typemarq="italique">“similar”</marquage>, <marquage typemarq="italique">“we are the same”</marquage>, and
          <marquage typemarq="italique">“we think the same”</marquage>. With an unequal frequency,
          not only interviewees were claiming that they were identical in saying, no matter the
          multilinguistic aspect, but also in doing, thus illustrating – according to them - a
          shared vision of <marquage typemarq="italique">managerial practices</marquage>. Hence,
          along with the observation of the use of identical words, the material revealed an
          apparent shared vision of the governance. This was confirmed by the observations made
          during many stays within the company: people in <marquage typemarq="italique">GoodScent</marquage> declared being satisfied and in tune with the management, and so
          they seemed to be, from what we were able to witness. Among the plethoric references to
          this so-called similar vision of how this good communication was embodied and in the name
          of what actors were claiming to be identical, two elements in particular were drawn to our
          attention, since their recurrence in all the interviews regardless of the cultural origin
          of the interviewees was really abundant: <marquage typemarq="italique">the
          openness</marquage> and <marquage typemarq="italique">the feeling of belonging to a
          family.</marquage> The terms <marquage typemarq="italique">“openness”</marquage> or
          <marquage typemarq="italique">“being open”</marquage> (we do not include synonyms nor
          circumlocutions) occur more than twenty times in the thirty interviews (even though some
          interviewees might have used it several times in an interview), and the reference to
          <marquage typemarq="italique">“being a family”</marquage> was found in twenty-height of
          them. We applied the above-described abductive method to all the interviews; we then
          compared all the interviews from a similar cultural area (Latino-America interviews on the
          one side, French ones on the other) in order to see if common implicit references and
          conceptions were being identified within a same group. We then cross-examined those
          references between the two “cultural” groups. This method enabled us to reveal our
          questioning in a proper and relevant way, given that what was looked at was the meaning
          people were giving to some ideas or notions (and their respective implicit conceptual
          background) in order to assess the supposed declared understanding they were
          sharing.</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa13"><no>13</no>
        <alinea>Although the use of these two words should not – and cannot – on their own solely
          justify the “open communication” encountered in the company (other factors surely
          influence why people do communicate well, such as the good results of the company, maybe
          an identical professional background or experience, interpersonal acquaintances…), in this
          paper we decided to focus on them since the underlying references the analysis of the
          material brought to light show real differences between the two cultural groups,
          differences actors do not seem to be aware of.</alinea>

        <alinea>Beyond the apparent obviousness of similar meaning of the notions mentioned,
          analyzing the data unveiled different realities associated to a same word, different
          practices yet related to a same discourse. Both cultural groups promote the notion of
          <marquage typemarq="italique">“openness”</marquage>, but the cross-cultural analysis shows
          that is not embodied the same way in respective universes. Hence, what seems crucial to
          know is whether this situation can still lead to compatible practices, or if the
          Latino-American employees will perceive as a proof of openness practices that are governed
          by another register for the French.</alinea>

        <alinea>This last sentence leads us to think that he compares what he knows about other
          working environments to <marquage typemarq="italique">GoodScent</marquage>’s one. He
          appreciates the possibility of talking about family topics without restraint and admits
          that this option, not specific to this company, still remains very different from what can
          be observed in other organizations (<marquage typemarq="italique">there is an appreciation
          and an understanding that the personal life is very important</marquage>). In his mind,
          the French seem to share the same vision regarding the importance of private life – not to
          say its primacy – above the professional one (<marquage typemarq="italique">the personal
          life is, has a high level of importance, I would say even slightly more than the
          professional</marquage>) which he considers as a sign of openness too. A Peruvian
          assistant also mentions this notion of openness very clearly: <marquage typemarq="italique">“Hemos visto una apertura grandísima”</marquage> <renvoi id="re1no12" idref="no12" typeref="note">12</renvoi>, she says, talking about a specific moment where she found
          herself in a middle of French guests, invited by her French manager to a private and
          family reception. She goes on: <marquage typemarq="italique">”Empezando porque aunque si
          no hablan español tratan de hablar de ciertas cositas. Si tú no hablas francés, tú tratas
          de que te entiendan en tu pequeño inglés y así sucesivamente</marquage><renvoi id="re1no13" idref="no13" typeref="note">13</renvoi>. In her mind, a proof of openness (<marquage typemarq="italique">hemos visto una</marquage> <marquage typemarq="italique">apertura</marquage> <marquage typemarq="italique">grandísima</marquage>) is reflected by
          the will of the French to relate to her beyond the linguistic barrier (<marquage typemarq="italique">porque aunque si no hablan español</marquage><renvoi id="re1no14" idref="no14" typeref="note">14</renvoi>). According to her, the slightest effort is relevant of the will of the
          French to interact (<marquage typemarq="italique">use of the verb “tratar”, to
          try</marquage>) and is enough for her to qualify it as a sign of openness. Another
          interview from a Colombian worker reveals that for her, the openness is measured according
          to someone’s relational ability, capacity of multiplying interactions. Talking about
          mundane topics (<marquage typemarq="italique">ciertas cositas</marquage><renvoi id="re1no15" idref="no15" typeref="note">15</renvoi>) does not belittle the positive analysis she makes of the
          situation, and it constitutes a sign of openness for her.</alinea>
      </para><para id="pa18"><no>18</no>
        <alinea>We would like to underline the fact that these conceptions were identically-found
          among the Latino-Americans’ interviews no matter what language they were expressing
          themselves in and no matter their profile. This observation echoes research outcomes about
          the use of a <marquage typemarq="italique">Lingua Franca</marquage>, in particular
          Tréguer-Felten’ s work, which claims the invisible footprint culture leaves on language is
          independent from the language in which one speaks (Tréguer-Felten, 2009a, 2009b, 2013).
          Other scholars mention that it is also independent from the degree of fluency people have
          in diverse languages (Louhiala-Salminen &amp; Charles, 2006). It also echoes the fact that
          even though it seems impossible to directly associate someone’s understanding to his/her
          cultural background, in the current case, the results clearly show a convergence as far as
          the items studied are concerned, not only between a same cultural group but also between
          the different Latino-American cultures represented. Of course, this does not mean that all
          the Latino-Americans could be considered as a single entity and that no divergence could
          be met neither among people from a single cultural group nor from the various
          Latino-American cultures.</alinea>

          important elements; on the one hand, the fact that the openness is intimately linked to
          the notion of word exchange and debate of ideas (<marquage typemarq="italique">one must be
          able to express himself</marquage>). On the other, this intellectual interaction is
          supposed to be aimed at operational objectives, helping the company to maintain a
          strategic position from an industrial and professional point of view thanks to
          cross-fertilization of ideas. From all three interviews, no reference is made to the
          possible evocation of personal topics or family subjects. Not once did the French
          perfumers associate the notion of <marquage typemarq="italique">“being open”</marquage> to

          French framework of meaning identified by d’Iribarne (d’Iribarne, 1989,) as well the
          centrality of the debate in the French decision-making process highlighted by other
          scholars as well (d’Iribarne, 1998; Chevrier, 2011b; Segal, 2009).</alinea>

        <alinea>Actors collectively reaffirm their will to share good communication and the
          importance attributed to the notion of openness. But if for the Latino-American employees
          being open means <marquage typemarq="italique">going towards</marquage> <marquage typemarq="italique">the other</marquage> from a relational and affective perspective, for
          the French it means discussing, exchanging ideas, which fundamentally implies an
          intellectual scope. Admittedly, in both cases interactive dynamics with the others are
          observed. We still clearly identify the French preference for a more abstract dimension,
          based on rationalization, whereas the Latino-Americans have a more instinctive and
          emotional understanding, and use an affect-based inter-relational process. If the latter
          feel that the French and they are alike, it is mainly due to the fact that the openness
          they refer to may be mistaken for an attitude that could be called courtesy. The
          interpretative process is based on a several-layer process: on external signs (gestures,
          mimics, words, attitudes), on people’s implicit framework of meanings, and on contextual
          elements. In fact, in the present case, the match between Latino-Americans’ expectations
          and French behavior lay upon a crossed understanding. The register the French mobilize
          without their knowledge is not led by the notion of openness, but rather a social pattern
          as well as a respect of etiquette (how to <marquage typemarq="italique">behave
          well</marquage> in such or such circumstances, meaning adequately with a given context).
          Since mutual readings made by each other are positive, divergent interpretations remain
          both unnoticed and harmless.</alinea>

        <alinea>A similar analysis-process has been carried out regarding the notion of <marquage typemarq="italique">family</marquage><renvoi id="re1no17" idref="no17" typeref="note">17</renvoi>. The findings also
          show divergent meaning attribution when the Latino-Americans use the term and when the
          three French perfumers use it. The underlying references show the Latino-Americans
          conceive the family as an entity led by affective motivations, and illustrates a will to
          protect the other members and to share all the important moments together (mention of
          celebrations of personal events such as birthdays, weddings, weekend-end parties…),
          whereas the French consider the family rather as a system, a social group whose members
          are supposed to share a common interest as a group and work closely (<marquage typemarq="italique">“what I mean by family is that it really is a team work, everybody
          works very close to one another…it is important for us to have this structure, small but
          very tight” </marquage>says a French perfumer<renvoi id="re1no18" idref="no18" typeref="note">18</renvoi>), and
          where dialogue and talking generate understanding and therefore efficiency. So the
          prevalence of the group over each individual who composes this very group seems to be more
          important and, additionally, no references to affective bonds or common festive
          celebrations were found. Again, although we can only refer to the three French perfumers
          interviewed in this research, these findings are fully consistent with other research made
          regarding French culture (d’Iribarne, 1989; Chevrier, 2011b; Segal, 2009)</alinea>

          will of “sharing” all the crucial moments of life <marquage typemarq="italique">(“si
          estamos en una fiesta…dejamos este protocolo …es “oh mi amigo, mi amiga”</marquage><renvoi id="re1no22" idref="no22" typeref="note">22</renvoi>). The relationship seems to be based on creating emotions,
          regardless of whether they are generated by professional or personal contexts. Their
          implicit underlying representation of a “good power”, associated to their fear of a “bad
          power”, seems to be articulated around two strategic factors. First, the demand for
          personalized relationships is strong <marquage typemarq="italique">(“son millares de cosas
          muy personales que salen de todo ese trabajo professional”</marquage><renvoi id="re1no23" idref="no23" typeref="note">23</renvoi>, <marquage typemarq="italique">“llega un momento en que ya es
          parte de uno”</marquage><renvoi id="re1no24" idref="no24" typeref="note">24</renvoi>). Secondly, they really are
          afraid of bosses who instil fear: <marquage typemarq="italique">“Al principio està ese
          temor y ese ver…al jefe francés muy alto…”</marquage><renvoi id="re1no25" idref="no25" typeref="note">25</renvoi>,
          that is, to their mind, those who appear as inhuman persons since they do not take the
          emotional dimension into consideration, and do not contribute to personal development.
          Therefore, the “good boss” is the one who can, on the one hand, demonstrate an ability to
          be mindful of others and to care about them, and that can include an affective dimension,
          and on the other hand, ensures the personal and professional evolution of the employee.
          These findings are consistent with previous research in Mexico and the use of the metaphor
          of <marquage typemarq="italique">little ants</marquage><renvoi id="re1no26" idref="no26" typeref="note">26</renvoi>
          whose individual growth helps to grow together (d’Iribarne, 2003, 2007). This double
          expectation seems to be well fulfilled by the way the French consider the development of
          professional skills. As a matter of fact, the Latino-American search for a relational
          scope is meeting the French will to implement a pedagogical approach aiming at “helping”
          the individual. This posture enables the French managers to value the role of mentor they
          play, posture already found in other research results on French Management and French
          culture (Segal, 2009). The skill-enhancement process is experienced positively by all the
          actors even though the meaning given to it varies according to the cultural universe. The
          connection between the two imaginaries is done naturally and without the actors being
          aware of it, the Latino-American expectations meeting the French logic of intellectual
          emancipation. These results are consistent with previous research made both on the French
          (d’Iribarne, 1989) and on some Southern-American situations where the need for a
          relational dimension between partners is demonstrated (d’Iribarne, 2003; Amado, Faucheux
          &amp; Laurent, 1991) or where some behavior, though possibly considered as shocking for
          western eyes due to what is seen as regressive, are the key to successful organizational
          dynamics (Joly, 2004).</alinea>

        misunderstandings”</marquage></titre><para id="pa26"><no>26</no>
        <alinea>Findings show that in this multicultural situation, actors do not really understand
          each other as far as they think they do, and yet, they are being efficient and cooperate
          successfully. In this very case, happy cultural cooperation does not mean that the
          protagonists share a mutual understanding. This result challenges the commonly met
          postulate in CCM that claims that mutual understanding is a prerequisite for collective
          efficiency in cross-cultural contexts. The main outcome of the study is that illusive
          beliefs in mutual understandings might not be harmful to the efficiency of operations
          coordination in cross-cultural contexts. This phenomenon could then, we suggest, be
          qualified as <marquage typemarq="italique">“productive
          misunderstandings”</marquage>.</alinea>

				1</no><titre><marquage typemarq="petitecap">Discussion</marquage></titre><para id="pa27"><no>27</no>
        <alinea>The findings may contravene research in CCM, which tends to claim that mutual
          understanding is a prerequisite for efficient collective action (Brannen &amp; Salk, 2000;
          Søderberg &amp; Holden, 2002). In our case, the invisible adjustment actors make remains
          hidden and unknown. It relies on compatible divergent understandings. Focusing on the
          concept of understanding leads us to clarify the notion of misunderstanding. Most of the
          time, a misunderstanding is defined through its negativity: the fact of not understanding
          well suggests that communication has not been established the way it should have been,
          that there is a need for clarification in order to get things back on track.
          Misunderstanding is by nature a distorted communication. The case study presented in this
          research raises the possibility of another definition of misunderstanding, closer to
          <marquage typemarq="italique">divergent understandings</marquage>. We are not dealing with
          incorrect understandings but rather with divergent meaning attributions. One author
          specifically found some evidence of this in research released in 2009 (Starck, 2009). He
          claims that “<marquage typemarq="italique">the misunderstandings that [he has] in mind lie
          most frequently in conflicting attributions that actors are making. These can be
          conflicting attributions about persons […], but as frequently they can be discrepant
          attributions about objects, artifacts, concepts, or other entities that populate our
          social worlds”</marquage><renvoi id="re1no27" idref="no27" typeref="note">27</renvoi>. From there he then developed
          the concept of <marquage typemarq="italique">heterarchy</marquage>, which can be defined
          as follows: <marquage typemarq="italique">“Heterarchy represents an organizational form of
          distributed intelligence in which units are laterally accountable according to diverse
          principles of evaluation </marquage>[…]. <marquage typemarq="italique">Posed most
          polemically: there are circumstances in which coordination takes place not despite but
          because of misunderstandings”</marquage><renvoi id="re1no28" idref="no28" typeref="note">28</renvoi>. This concept
          seemed relevant to us as the observations made in the case presented were showing
          non-conflictual misunderstandings. Research conducted in intercultural communication also
          mentions possible misunderstandings (Demorgon, 1989; Hall &amp; Hall; 1990), but only
          refers to their negative aspect. Besides, they rather focus on languages and social
          interaction dynamics. They tend to show that the language barrier is usually not dealt
          with efficiently, and most studies focus on the cost this language dimension has for the
          companies. Understanding the language use in building interrelations within international
          contexts is critical, but developing a design to create cooperation should not be limited
          to that perspective only. The findings of this case confirm much research on intercultural
          communication that claims that it is a complex mechanism (Gumperz, 2003) and that
          companies should take a closer look at the consequences entailed by working in
          multicultural/multilingual environments (Cohen &amp; Kassis-Henderson, 2012). In line with
          some research on language, this case shows that the linguistic dimension should not be
          reduced to its communicative function, far from it. But our case, actors do not mention
          any linguistic barrier, nor do they mention any communication issues as the literature
          frequently reports (Charles, 2006). Other research in CCM claims that individuals in
          cross-cultural contexts develop some hybridity (Brannen and Salk, 2002) and our case can
          certainly be included in that perspective, even though the adjustment made here does not
          stem from a conscious and volunteer process from the actors, but is implicit and
          subconscious. Likewise, the concept of co-constructed <marquage typemarq="italique">negotiated meaning</marquage> brought to light by some scholars (Primecz, Romani and
          Sackmann, 2011) refers to conscious-led dynamics, which is not the case in <marquage typemarq="italique">GoodScent</marquage>.</alinea>

				2</no><titre><marquage typemarq="petitecap">Limitations</marquage></titre><para id="pa28"><no>28</no>
        <alinea>As with all research work this study presents some limitations, and a series of
          questions can be raised. Can this phenomenon be valid in any cross-cultural encounter, or
          does it require specific circumstances or characteristics? Do the working nationalities
          involved have to do with it? Does the company’s location have an impact? The present case,
          as previously mentioned, takes place in a favorable context, particularly regarding the
          market and the period concerned, not to mention the sector. The question that naturally
          arises is the following one: assuming a change in context – meaning a less satisfactory
          situation, such as a drop in sales or losses of market share – when would these <marquage typemarq="italique">misunderstandings</marquage> (or <marquage typemarq="italique">divergent understandings</marquage> as we may call them) become problematic? The case
          revealed this hidden phenomenon of invisible and hidden mutual adjustment, which combines
          politeness with fortuitous acquiescence well. Still, this internal delicate balance
          remains very fragile and may constitute a weakness, all the more because none of the
          protagonists are aware of it. This may also refer to the single-loop collective
          organizational learning process (Argyris &amp; Schön, 1978) and results might be rather
          different in a more complex context. Besides, the functional structure and the general
          organization should be mentioned, since this model could possibly not be found in
          situations where role attribution is not displayed in such a precise nationality-oriented
          way. Lastly, another aspect to be mentioned is that the given case occurs in Miami, and
          all the actors involved are migrants. This may create a sort of <marquage typemarq="italique">migrant posture</marquage>, and may also have an impact on reducing
          cooperation barriers. From then on, we might consider an additional hypothesis to explain
          the successful outcome: since everyone is a migrant, it may create a community of
          otherness-based dynamics. Further research on all these aspects is required to identify
          the context characteristics which may enable this phenomenon to take place.</alinea>

        <alinea><marquage typemarq="italique">Productive misunderstandings</marquage>, or <marquage typemarq="italique">divergent-understandings</marquage>, may not be harmful to cross
          cultural cooperation, but it seems both uncertain and hazardous to bet on this spontaneous
          double mechanism of positive and compatible understandings, regardless of the cultures
          involved and the operations concerned. Of course, in the case of a successful
          cross-cultural interaction situation, disclosing the hidden mechanism that enables people
          to efficiently coordinate operations might seem useless not to say risky, as disclosing it
          may endanger the cooperation. But in less happy situations, or when planning and
          organizing cross-cultural encounters, taking a look at what lies under people’s
          representations, ideas or conceptions might be of great help. Bringing the underlying
          meaning of an understanding and the notion of “intercultural competence” is being
          developed both by scholars (Barmeyer, 2012; Faust, 2015) and practitioners, but is rather
          focusing on the cultural dimension and associated to expected behavior rather than on the
          linguistic dimension. Intercultural competence is usually viewed as an individual skill
          and dealt with in a decontextualized way whereas a contextualized interactionist
          perspective is required. We suggest this very intercultural competence should intertwine
          language, frameworks of references people mobilize to make things meaningful to them, and
          the given elements of a precise and unique situation in terms of market, sector, location
          etc. Warning management about the illusion of mutual understanding is to be considered as
          a serious option too, the advice being to question apparent understanding and not taking
          it for granted just because of similar sayings or similar doings. It may seem wise to make
          sure the dynamics imposed by cross cultural cooperation are optimized.</alinea>

        <alinea>The objective of this qualitative study of a multicultural Franco-Latino-American
          fragrance company is to shed light on the deep mechanisms that are implemented by actors
          without their realizing it, thus illustrating - beyond a so-called mutual understanding –
          that the real reasons for which they actually have a quality and efficient cooperation
          differ from the representation they have of it. It may be called a misunderstanding; In
          fact we speak in favor of a prefix that does not intrinsically refer to a negative
          dimension or to a form of wrongness, but just to a different meaning attribution.
          Therefore, when dealing with multicultural contexts or situations, and more specifically
          when operation coordination is concerned, the compatibility of different visions and
          understandings should rather be clearly addressed. Divergent meanings might not always
          necessarily be considered as antagonistic and unproductive regarding collective action
          efficiency.</alinea>

        <alinea>As a conclusion, this article illustrates the fact that - unlike the implicit
          fundamentals of CCM research based on the required alignment of practices and the supposed
          universal dimension of management tools pretend - successful management in a cross
          cultural environment does not necessarily involve cross-cultural understanding (see
          Table<marquage typemarq="petitecap"> 1</marquage> <marquage typemarq="italique">supra</marquage>). Protagonists are collectively in some illusion about their complete
          mutual understanding. The case shows that on some points at least, they do not understand
          one another as far as they claim they do. The way each actor sees the other and decodes a
          situation has remained unchanged. It is the unexpected combination of positive readings of
          the situation within each cultural reference system on the one hand and with one another
          on the other hand, that generates the claimed satisfaction and well-being. Harmony is
          real, but for different reasons than the individuals imagine. Through individual
          reinterpretation, generated by each culture’s own reading grid, some subconscious and
          unexpected combinations can emerge, without people realizing.</alinea>

        <alinea>Findings from this atypical case give new orientations for the constructive and
          productive understanding of intercultural situations, enabling organizations to develop an
          adapted, contextualized and efficient approach to cultural management: we claim that even
          in the absence of difficulties or conflicts, multicultural organizations should still
          consider success with care and concern. A wisdom-driven attitude would then consist in
          being aware of the potential fragility of a balanced internal context. A sudden change at
          a macro or micro level could ruin the organization’s supposed established inter-unit
          relational success, leaving the actors all the more surprised that they are in the true
          belief of getting along well with their managers thanks to a deeply-rooted
          closeness.</alinea>
